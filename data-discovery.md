# üîç Data Discovery

{% hint style="info" %}
Good to know: as an admin or editor, you can toggle to "viewer" mode in the bottom left corner to see what people from your team would see when using Secoda.
{% endhint %}

Editors, viewers, and admins can all use the search feature in Secoda to explore documentation, dictionary terms, and datasets within Secoda. Since not everyone always knows the exact name of what they're looking for, the search feature allows you to browse relevant resources.&#x20;

Part of the search functionality is being able to filter by resource type.&#x20;
