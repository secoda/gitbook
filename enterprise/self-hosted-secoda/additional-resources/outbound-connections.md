# Outbound Connections

To have the best self-hosted experience we recommend allowing outbound connections. If your organization's internal security policies do not allow outbound connections the following functionality in Secoda will not work.

* Secoda AI
* OAuth Integrations
  * Slack
  * GitHub
  * BigQuery
  * Power BI
* Email Notifications
* Email Login

If you have questions about workarounds for this functionality, please email support@secoda.co
