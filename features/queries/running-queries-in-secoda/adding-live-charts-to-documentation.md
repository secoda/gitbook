# Chart Blocks

## Create a Chart Block

After executing a query, you can choose to display the data as a chart in a chart block. Below are the steps to share a query as a chart.

1. Click `Graph Results` on the bottom of the query block
2. Select the x-axis, y-axis, and optionally the dimension. These options will be automatically selected  based on the data in the query results.
3. Select the format of the values (numeric, percentage, currency, decimal)
4. Click `Create graph`
5. The chart will be embedded directly below the query

At this time the chart blocks only support line graphs for time-series data.

Additionally, a chart can be embedded anywhere within the documentation by using the `/Query Chart` command. Here's the steps to do this.

1. Use the `/Query Chart` command in the documentation editor
2. Select a query from the Query option
3. Select the x-axis, y-axis, and optionally dimension, and format
4. Click `Create graph`
