# Queries

Queries exist in two forms in Secoda:

The first is queries that we extract from an integration. These queries are used to calculate lineage and popularity. See below for more information!

{% content-ref url="documenting-queries.md" %}
[documenting-queries.md](documenting-queries.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The second is queries that can be written and run from within Secoda. Secoda can be a great tool for running analyses and documenting these analyses for future use. Use the link below to learn more.

{% content-ref url="running-queries-in-secoda/" %}
[running-queries-in-secoda](running-queries-in-secoda/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
