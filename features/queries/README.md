# Queries

Queries exist in two forms in Secoda:

The first is queries that we ingest from an integration. These queries are used to calculate lineage, and can have metadata added to them within Secoda like any other resource. See below for more information!

{% content-ref url="documenting-queries.md" %}
[documenting-queries.md](documenting-queries.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The second is queries that can be written and run from within Secoda. Secoda can be a great tool for running analyses and documenting these analyses for future use. Use the link below to learn more.
