# Extracted Queries

Extracted queries are pulled in directly from the integration. Secoda extracts the Query History as well as the Creation Query for the resource.

## Query History

By clicking on Queries tab from a resource in Secoda, you can see the query history for that resource. Query history is extracted for:

* [snowflake-integration](../../integrations/data-warehouses/snowflake-integration/ "mention")
* [redshift-integration](../../integrations/data-warehouses/redshift-integration/ "mention")
* [aws-glue-integration](../../integrations/data-pipeline-tools/aws-glue-integration/ "mention")

The query can easily be copied, and run in Secoda through the [Query editor in a document](running-queries-in-secoda/), or just viewed through the tab shown below.

## Creation queries

You can find the query that is used to create the resource in the top right hand corner by clicking the `</>` icon. You can also copy that code for ease of use.
