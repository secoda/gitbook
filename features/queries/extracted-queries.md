# Extracted Queries

Secoda seamlessly extracts queries directly from an integration, pulling both the Query History and the Creation Query for each resource.

## Query History

By clicking on the Queries tab from a resource in Secoda, you can access the resource's query history. Query history is extracted from the following integrations:

* [snowflake-integration](../../integrations/data-warehouses/snowflake-integration/ "mention")
* [redshift-integration](../../integrations/data-warehouses/redshift-integration/ "mention")
* [aws-glue-integration](../../integrations/data-pipeline-tools/aws-glue-integration/ "mention")
* [bigquery-integration](../../integrations/data-warehouses/bigquery-integration/ "mention")

### How Secoda Extracts Queries

During the extraction process, Secoda retrieves the **last 24 hours of queries** run on the resource directly from the integration. Any new, previously unseen queries are added to the list of queries associated with that resource in Secoda. This comprehensive list can be found under the Queries tab on the resource page, as shown below.

### How to Access Queries Run on a Resource

1. Click into a resource from the Catalog or find it using Search.
2. Navigate to the Queries tab.

For each query run on that resource, you will see the following additional information:

* **SQL Query:** The full query run on the resource from the integration source.
* **Average Runtime:** The average amount of time it takes to run the query.
* **Total Runtime:** The total amount of run time in the past 24 hours.
* **Total Runs:** The number of times it's been run in the past 24 hours.
* **Resources:** The list of resources that the query references.

3. Click on a query to see the Query Summary. The Summary allows you to:

* View visual analytics on that particular query.
* See a query history with date, user, run time, and cost details.
* Filter the history to see data from the last 30, 7, or 1 day.

## Creation queries

For resources created from a query (e.g., Views), the Creation Query can be found by clicking the `</>` icon in the top right-hand corner. This query can also be copied for easy reuse.
