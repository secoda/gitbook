# Adding Live Charts to Documentation

After executing a query, you can choose to display it to viewers as a chart instead of a query. Below are the steps to share a query as a chart.&#x20;

The first step to creating a chart is to [execute the query](running-queries-in-secoda.md). Once the query has run, flip to the "chart tab", which will initially show up blank. Click on the button on the right hand side to open up the chart options.

Once you open the right-hand tab, you will be able to select the chart type, axis, scale, order and sorting preference. Secoda allows editors to create:

* Line graphs&#x20;
* Bar Charts
* Pie Charts
* Stacked Area
* Horizontal Bar
* Scatter Plots

If you only want the chart to display, you can select "prefer chart" and viewers will only see the chart in Secoda instead of the query. Charts can be embedded anywhere in the product including collections, questions, tables, charts, queries and docs.&#x20;
