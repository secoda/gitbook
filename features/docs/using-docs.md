# Using Docs

Docs are like a Notion document with live queries and charts. You can reference your data catalogue and data dictionary while creating robust data analysis in Secoda. Analysis documents are useful once you've connected your database to Secoda and given Secoda permission to query the data in the database. After you've done this, you can open the analysis document to view a blank page that looks like the picture below

This document allows you to add query blocks, text blocks and charting blocks to document your analysis from one place. To add a new block, hoover over the blank line above the query editor and press on the block that you want to add to the document.

Query blocks allow editors to query the data directly from Secoda. You can add a text block to add additional information before or after the query in case someone wants to understand how they can better use the query. The query editor is flexible and allows editors to export the results, expand the query, hide the query, filter the results and choose which data base to query.

By adding a charting block below the query editor, teams can visualize their queries directly in Secoda. This can let data teams visualize and document ad hoc analysis directly where the rest of their data knowledge lives.

After the chart is added to Secoda, editors can press the "edit chart" button on the top right of the chart to change the chart appearance, type and attributes. After the chart has been changed in the way that the editor was planning on seeing the data, editors can press "save changes" in the bottom right corner to save all changes that have been made and return to the analysis document.

Analysis documents can be shared with any employee and can be indexed by the central search. All analysis documents will display an "Analysis" button on the right hand side on the results in the search.
