# Inbox & Announcements

Support teams have Intercom to centralize all their communication with customers and to build self service. Today, we’re excited to introduce the first data inbox, which centralizes all communication, notifications and requests associated with data for the data team.The data inbox in Secoda centralizes:

* Schema changes that you should look at
* Downstream and upstream impact your resources
* Description requests
* Data Access Management requests
* Documentation changes
* Tests and DQ failures relevant to you

In addition to this, we’ve also added the ability for data teams to send outbound messages using Secoda, meaning that you can now send Announcements via the UI.&#x20;

Users have the ability to send general Announcements directly from the Inbox tab, but also from any specific resource. For example, if your announcement pertains to a table, you can click into that table and find the megaphone :mega: button in the side panel to create an Announcement.

One main use case for this feature is sharing with your organization when new dashboards or tables have been introduced.&#x20;

**Here’s a video of the feature:**&#x20;
