## Managing Search Views

You can save Search filters for quick access to common searches. These can be personal or shared with your team.

### **Creating a Search View**

1. Click into Search and select relevant filters to add.
2. Click 'Save view' in the top right.
3. Title the filtered view and set the Team visibility (Optional).
   * Note: If you leave the "Team visibility" section blank, these will only be saved to your personal space.
4. Access previously created Views in the top left of search under 'All results'.

**Note:** Personal views are only visible to you and can be used to customize your workspace without affecting team settings.
