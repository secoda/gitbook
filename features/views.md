## Managing Views

You can save filters for quick access to common searches and subsets of resources in the catalog. These can be personal or shared with your team.

### **Catalog Views**

1. Click into the Catalog and select relevant filters to add.
2. Click **Save view** in the top right.
3. Title the filtered view and set the Team visibility (Optional). If you leave the "Team visibility" section blank, these will only be saved to your personal space.
4. Access previously created Views in the top left of Catalog under **All results**.

**Note:** Personal views are only visible to you and can be used to customize your workspace without affecting team settings.
