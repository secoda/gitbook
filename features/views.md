## **Catalog Views**&#x20;

Catalog Views allow you to create personalized or team-accessible filters in the Catalog, making it easier to access frequently used resources.

### **Creating a Catalog View**

1. **Access the Catalog:** Open the Catalog and click the 'Views' button located in the top right corner.
2. **View Existing or Create New:**
   * You can view any Team-level Views previously created by teammates.
   * To create a new view, click on '+ Create new view.'
3. **Configure Your View:**
   * **Name the View:** Enter a name for the View.
   * **Add Filters:** Select the desired filters to apply to this View.
   * **Team Visibility:** Decide if this view should be visible to Team(s). If you want it to be a personal view, leave the 'Team visibility' section empty.
4. **Save the View:** Click 'Create view' to save. You can now navigate back to this View at any time from the Catalog page.

## Managing Search Views

Just like with Catalog Views, you can save Search filters for quick access to common searches. These can be personal or shared with your team.

### **Creating a Search View**

1. Click into Search and select relevant filters to add.
2. Click 'Save view'.
3. Title the filtered view and set the Team visibility (Optional).
   * Note: If you leave the "Team visibility" section blank, these will only be saved to your personal space.
4. Access previously created Views in the top left of search under 'All results'.

**Note:** Personal views are only visible to you and can be used to customize your workspace without affecting team settings.
