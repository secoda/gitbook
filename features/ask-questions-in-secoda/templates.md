# Templates for Questions

As an Admin, you can create templates for questions to streamline your team's requests. If you're asking a question, you can utilize these templates instead of a blank question request.

## How to Create Templates in Secoda

To create a Questions template in Secoda, click the **Templates** button beside the **New Question Button**.

You can create a new template or edit current ones from this view.

### Setting a Template as default

You can also set a template as the default format for editors and viewers to ask questions. To do this, click on the three dots beside the template you'd like to make the default.

In this menu, you can also delete and edit templates.
