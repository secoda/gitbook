## Use Slack to Search and Ask on Secoda

First, you’ll need to connect Secoda to your Slack workspace following these instructions.

After you’ve done so, anyone in your Slack workspace can ask a question using a Slack command: `/ask,` followed by their question.

From here, you'll be prompted to ask your question and submit information to follow up. If you're an admin, if you make a [question template](templates.md) the default, the template will show up on this Slack question form.
