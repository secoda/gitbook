# Asking Data Questions from Slack

You are able to ask questions from Slack a few different ways. First, youâ€™ll need to make sure Secoda is connected to your Slack workspace. Ask your workspace Admin for assistance here, or if you're the Admin you can set this up: [#how-to-set-up](../../integrations/productivity-tools/slack-connection/#how-to-set-up "mention").

## Use Slack to get AI Responses

If you'd like to quickly get an AI generated response, you can ask the Secoda AI Assistant directly from your team's designated Data Requests Slack channel. These can then be published to your Secoda instance with one click. Read more about that here [slack-ai-assistant.md](../../integrations/productivity-tools/slack-connection/slack-ai-assistant.md "mention")

## Use Questions template in Slack

If you'd like to submit a Question using the [Questions template ](templates.md)that your workspace Admin has created, you can follow these steps.&#x20;

Use the Slack command: `/ask,` followed by your question. See how it gives you the option to ask the Secoda AI Assistant here as well.

From here, you'll be prompted to ask your question and submit the following information.

The Question will then appear in the Questions UI within Secoda. Once it's answered, you will receive a notification in Slack.

You can view your asked questions by going into the Secoda app and going to the Questions tab or going to the Slack channel that has been set up to receive notifications from Secoda.
