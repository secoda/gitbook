# Asking Data Questions from Slack

Check out our page on using the AI within Slack to ask data requests: [slack-ai-assistant.md](../../integrations/productivity-tools/slack-connection/slack-ai-assistant.md "mention")

## Use Slack to Search and Ask on Secoda

First, youâ€™ll need to connect Secoda to your Slack workspace following these instructions.

After youâ€™ve done so, anyone in your Slack workspace can ask a question using a Slack command: `/ask,` followed by their question.

From here, you'll be prompted to ask your question and submit information to follow up. If you're an admin, if you make a [question template](templates.md) the default, the template will show up on this Slack question form.

You can view your asked questions by going into the Secoda app and going to the Questions tab or going to the Slack channel that has been set up to receive notifications from Secoda.
