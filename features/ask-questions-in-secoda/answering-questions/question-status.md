# Changing the question status

## **Data questions status with Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are 4 different statuses for questions, and each question can only have one status. These are:

* Answered
* In review
* In progress
* Unanswered&#x20;
* Cancelled&#x20;

Assignees and users can change the status of questions and the assignee will be notified.&#x20;

You can also sort all of your questions by status. Simply go to the Questions page, and type in the status of questions that you're looking for.&#x20;
