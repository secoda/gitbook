# dbt Metrics Layer Data Dictionary

The dbt (data build tool) Semantics Layer is a tool that allows organizations to define and enforce data standards and conventions within their data infrastructure. By establishing a semantics layer, organizations can ensure that data is consistent, standardized, and easy to understand across different data sources and systems.

Secoda is a data discovery tool that automates data lineage, documentation, and data discovery. By integrating Secoda with the dbt Semantics Layer, organizations can leverage the data management and data governance capabilities of both tools to improve the transparency, trustworthiness, and understandability of their data.

## How to Integrate dbt Metrics Layer with Secoda

This integration allows you to define the metrics in SQL and auto document them in Secoda based on the SQL query.&#x20;
