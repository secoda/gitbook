# Custom Dictionary Properties

## How to Add Custom Properties

Custom properties are only applicable to the single definition that you're editing.&#x20;

To add a custom property to a dictionary term, click on the term you'd like to add the property to. Underneath the default properties, you'll find a button that says **+ Add a property**. Click on this to input your property name, and then the property you'd like to assign the term

To delete a custom property, click on the custom property name, and then click **Delete** property.
