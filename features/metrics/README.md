# Data Dictionary

A data dictionary is a document or database that provides definitions and metadata for data assets within an organization. Creating a data dictionary can provide several benefits:

1. Improved data transparency: A data dictionary can help make data more transparent and understandable, making it easier for others to use and trust the data.
2. Enhanced data governance: A data dictionary can help establish clear roles and responsibilities for data management and ensure that data is being used appropriately.
3. Improved data discovery: A data dictionary can make it easier for users to find and access data assets, improving productivity and efficiency.
4. Enhanced data security: A data dictionary can help organizations identify and protect sensitive data, ensuring that it is only accessed by authorized personnel.
5. Improved data quality: A data dictionary can help organizations identify and address data quality issues, improving the overall quality of their data.

**Good to know:** The Data Dictionary is different from the Documents feature in that it has set fields (i.e. terms, definition, owner) and is one place for all of your data terms. \
\
Documents, on the other hand, have open fields (customizable) and allow you to provide more context on specific tables or datasets.&#x20;
