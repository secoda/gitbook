# Personalize your data portal

## **How to personalize Secoda for your company** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are various personalization options for Secoda users. These personalization options are displayed to viewers when they first come into Secoda. As an admin, you're able to "lock" some of these personalizations. If you don't lock these, then editors and viewers can personalize their workspace as they'd like.&#x20;

To start personalizing your workspace:&#x20;

* Go to **Settings** from the sidebar
* Go to **Appearance** to change your workspace home background.&#x20;
  * As an admin, this is where you can lock the workspace background for other members on your team.&#x20;
  * As an editor or viewer, if your admin hasn't locked this feature, you can edit your background here.&#x20;
