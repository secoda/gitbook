  Secoda's Search is designed to help you find any data objects (tables,
  columns, explore, dictionary terms, Mode Reports, etc.) without even knowing
  exactly what they’re called.

# Search

## Top Search

The search bar at the top of the page is always available to find or quickly navigate to any data asset.

Space works as a delimiter in the search, so if you search for `order items` you'll get results with both "order" _and_ "items", whereas if you search for `order_items` you'll get results that are looking for "order\_items" as one word.

Note that when you search for multiple words, the order of the search terms matters!

All search results are sorted by relevance and popularity, so you’ll see what’s being used the most on the top.&#x20;

## Side Nav Search

Click on different tabs below the search bar to see results from a specific data source. For example, if you're looking for a Mode dashboard, click on **Data -> Mode ->Personal -> Payments** as shown below. You can use the side nav to filter by a table, source, schema or folder that you want to view in the data folder.&#x20;

## Search Results Page

After you've typed a query into the top search, hit `Enter`/`Return` on your keyboard to see a full search results page and browse more high level information at once.
