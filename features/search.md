# Search

## Top Search

Use the search bar at the top of the page is always available to find or quickly navigate to any data asset. You can search for terms in plain language, or by the table name and data source if you already know what you're looking for.&#x20;

The space bar operates as a "and" in the search function. For example, if you search for `sales revenue` you'll get results with both "sales" _and_ "revenue", whereas if you search for `sales_revenue` you'll get results that are looking for "sales\_revenue" as one word.

All search results are sorted by relevance and recency, so you’ll see what’s being used the most frequently first.

## Side Nav Search

Click on different tabs below the search bar to see results from a specific data source. For example, if you're looking for a Mode dashboard, click on **Data -> Mode ->Personal -> Payments** as shown below. You can use the side nav to filter by a table, source, schema or folder that you want to view in the data folder.&#x20;
