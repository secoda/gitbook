## Nav Search

Click on different tabs below the search bar to see results from a specific data source. For example, if you're looking for a Mode dashboard, click on **Data -> Mode ->Personal -> Payments** as shown below. You can use the side nav to filter by a table, source, schema or folder that you want to view in the data folder.&#x20;
