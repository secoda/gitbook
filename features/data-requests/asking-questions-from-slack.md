# Asking Data Questions from Slack

## Use Slack to Search and Ask on Secoda

After youâ€™ve done so, anyone in your Slack workspace can ask a question using a Slack command: `/ask,` followed by their question.&#x20;

From here, you'll be prompted to ask your question and submit information to follow up. If you're an admin, if you make a [question template](templates.md) the default, the template will show up on this Slack question form.
