# Catalog

Once you connect an integration to your workspace, all of the metadata from that source will appear in the Catalog section.

Follow the steps on [#how-to-add-integrations](../getting-started/secoda-as-an-admin/connect-your-data/#how-to-add-integrations "mention") to ensure that they're added to the correct Teams. If you haven't built out any Teams yet, the metadata will be added to the default General team which you can edit afterwards.

If you'd like a Team to only have access to specific Catalog resources, such as tables or columns,  without granting them access to the entire integration, you can do so like this:
