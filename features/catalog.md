# Catalog

## **Introduction**&#x20;

The Catalog is your central hub for all metadata from your connected integrations. Once an integration is connected, its metadata populates the Catalog, making it ready for organization and management.

## **Adding Catalog Metadata to Teams**&#x20;

By default, metadata is assigned to the 'General' team. To manage and reassign metadata to different teams within your workspace, follow these steps [#how-to-add-integrations](../getting-started/secoda-as-an-admin/connect-your-data/#how-to-add-integrations "mention").&#x20;

## Editing in the Catalog

For efficient management of multiple resources, learn how to perform bulk edits in the Catalog view here [bulk-editing-resources.md](../resource-and-metadata-management/add-documentation/bulk-editing-resources.md "mention").

## Applying Filters to the Catalog

Enhance your navigation within the Catalog by applying filters. Detailed instructions can be found here [#applying-filters-in-catalog](filters.md#applying-filters-in-catalog "mention").

## Creating and Managing Catalog Views

Create custom filtered Views of the Catalog to streamline access to frequently used resources. Learn how to create these Views here [views.md](views.md "mention").

## Exporting Catalog Metadata

* **Export a Filtered Subset of Resources:** Admins and Editors can export data from the Catalog to a CSV file. After setting the desired filters, use the three-dot menu and select 'Export page as CSV'.

* **Comprehensive Exporting:** For detailed guidance on exporting all Catalog resources, refer to our full documentation on [import-and-export-data.md](../resource-and-metadata-management/import-and-export-data.md "mention").

## Limiting Resource Access in a Catalog

Create custom access rules to limit access to particular tables or columns without exposing the entire integration. For step-by-step instructions on adding resources to teams one-by-one, follow these steps using [automations.md](automations.md "mention") to pull that subset of resources:

To add resources one-by-one, follow these steps:

## Reordering and Sorting Catalog Columns

Admins can customize the display of columns to emphasize key information. To rearrange columns, click 'Rearrange columns' and drag the desired metadata to a more prominent position at the top of the list. See the demonstration in the gif below for a visual guide.

For sorting, click on the desired column header, then choose either ascending or descending order.&#x20;

These adjustments will apply universally across the workspace, enhancing visibility for all users.&#x20;
