# Catalog

The Catalog serves as the central repository for metadata from your connected integrations. Once an integration is connected to your workspace, all metadata from that source populates the Catalog, ready for further action and organization.

To manage how metadata is assigned to different Teams within your workspace, follow the steps  [#how-to-add-integrations](../getting-started/secoda-as-an-admin/connect-your-data/#how-to-add-integrations "mention"). If no Teams have been set up, metadata will automatically be assigned to the default 'General' team, which you can reassign or edit later.

## Editing in the Catalog

For efficient management of multiple resources, learn how to perform bulk edits in the Catalog view here [bulk-editing-resources.md](../resource-and-metadata-management/add-documentation/bulk-editing-resources.md "mention").

## Applying Filters to the Catalog

Enhance your navigation within the Catalog by applying filters. Detailed instructions can be found here [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").

## Creating and Managing Catalog Views

Create custom filtered Views of the Catalog to streamline access to frequently used resources. Learn how to create these Views here [views.md](views.md "mention").

## Exporting Catalog Metadata

Admins and Editors can export data from the Catalog to a CSV file. After applying necessary filters, use the three-dot menu and select 'Export page as CSV'.&#x20;

For comprehensive guidance on exporting all Catalog resources, refer to our full documentation on [import-and-export-data.md](../resource-and-metadata-management/import-and-export-data.md "mention").

## Limiting Resource Access in a Catalog

If you'd like a Team to only have access to specific Catalog resources, such as tables or columns, without granting them access to the entire integration, you can create an [automations.md](automations.md "mention") to pull that subset of resources:

To add resources one-by-one, follow these steps:

## Reordering Catalog Columns

Admins can reorder metadata columns to prioritize important metadata, such as dragging the 'Verification Tag' to a more prominent position. Changes will be visible across the workspace for all users, as shown in the gif below.
