# Catalog

Once you connect an integration to your workspace, all of the metadata from that source will appear in the Catalog section.

Follow the steps on [#how-to-add-integrations](../getting-started/secoda-as-an-admin/connect-your-data/#how-to-add-integrations "mention") to ensure that they're added to the correct Teams. If you haven't built out any Teams yet, the metadata will be added to the default General team which you can edit afterwards.

## Identify undocumented Catalog resources

To identify resources in the catalog that have or have not been documented yet, you can follow the steps here to [#search-within-the-catalog](search-and-home-page.md#search-within-the-catalog "mention").

## Limit resources in a Catalog

If you'd like a Team to only have access to specific Catalog resources, such as tables or columns,  without granting them access to the entire integration, you can do so like this:

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/0726a1f58ec14ac59321324b1ad12cf3?sid=f6e2318f-866e-41d1-aa6c-876343958bf2" %}

## Re-order Catalog columns

Admins are able to re-order the metadata columns, in whatever order they'd like. Let's say you want to put more emphasis on the Verification Tag. You can drag that column to be the first column next to the resource name so that it is more visible to your users.

This change will persist at the workspace level for all of your users. In the gif below, you'll see that once the change is made, and the screen is refreshed, the change persists.
