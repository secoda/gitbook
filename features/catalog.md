# Catalog

## **Introduction**&#x20;

The Catalog is your central hub for all metadata from your connected integrations. Once an integration is connected, its metadata populates the Catalog, making it ready for organization and management.

## **Adding Catalog Metadata to Teams**&#x20;

By default, metadata is assigned to the 'General' team. To manage and reassign metadata to different teams within your workspace, follow these steps [#how-to-add-integrations](../getting-started/secoda-as-an-admin/connect-your-data/#how-to-add-integrations "mention").&#x20;

## Editing in the Catalog

For efficient management of multiple resources, learn how to perform bulk edits in the Catalog view here [bulk-editing-resources.md](../resource-and-metadata-management/add-documentation/bulk-editing-resources.md "mention").

## Applying Filters to the Catalog

Enhance your navigation within the Catalog by applying filters. Detailed instructions can be found here [#applying-filters-in-catalog](filters.md#applying-filters-in-catalog "mention").

## Creating and Managing Catalog Views

Create custom filtered Views of the Catalog to streamline access to frequently used resources. Learn how to create these Views here [views.md](views.md "mention").

## Exporting Catalog Metadata

* **Export a Filtered Subset of Resources:** Admins and Editors can export data from the Catalog to a CSV file. After setting the desired filters, use the three-dot menu and select 'Export page as CSV'.

* **Comprehensive Exporting:** For detailed guidance on exporting all Catalog resources, refer to our full documentation on [import-and-export-data.md](../resource-and-metadata-management/import-and-export-data.md "mention").

## Limiting Resource Access in a Catalog

Create custom access rules to limit access to particular tables or columns without exposing the entire integration. For step-by-step instructions on adding resources to teams one-by-one, follow these steps using [automations.md](automations.md "mention") to pull that subset of resources:

To add resources one-by-one, follow these steps:

## Reordering Catalog Columns

Admins can reorder columns to highlight important information. Click 'Rearrange columns', then drag the metadata you'd like to be more visible up to the top of the list. These changes will be reflected across the workspace for all users, as demonstrated in the gif below.
