  While you cannot add custom properties to your data directly from Secoda, you
  can indeed insert custom properties in your metadata.

# Adding Custom Column Properties

This allows you to add more context and organize the datasets that you've integrated to Secoda.&#x20;

## Inserting a custom property to a single table

To insert a custom property to a single table, select the table you'd like to edit. You can do this by searching for it by name in the search bar, or finding it in the left hand navigation bar via the **Data** button.&#x20;

After you've selected your table, go to the **Columns** tab.&#x20;

Below the tab towards the right side, click the **Custom Properties** button. Then, click **Add New Custom Property**.&#x20;

After the page refreshes, you'll be able to view your custom property within the table and add values to it.&#x20;

### Inserting a custom property to multiple tables

If you'd like to insert a custom property to multiple tables, you'll need to export these tables as a CSV first.&#x20;

From there, you can add the custom property that you'd like, and then port this back into Secoda. Once this is ported back, you'll see a property and field with the new column that you've added.&#x20;
