# Custom Tags

## How to Use Tags

Tags are a static way to label Resources with useful context that other users in your workspace need to know. Tags can be used as a communication channel in your workspace, for example, you could create a `Do Not Delete` tag, to communicate to others in the workspace that assets should not be deleted.&#x20;

## Creating New Tags

1. Navigate to Workspace settings by clicking the `Settings` tab in the sidebar
2. Under Workspace settings, select `Tags`
3. Click the `Create Tag` button to create a new tag
4. Enter Name, Tag Description, and choose a logo and colour to represent the tag
