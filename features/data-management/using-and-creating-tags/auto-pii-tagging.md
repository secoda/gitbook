# PII Tag

PII (Personally Identifiable Information) tags are used to identify data assets that contain personal information that could be used to identify an individual. PII tags can be used to help organizations protect personal data and comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

There are several benefits to using PII tags:

1. Enhanced data privacy: By using PII tags, organizations can identify and protect personal data, helping to ensure that it is only accessed by authorized personnel and used in accordance with data privacy regulations.
2. Improved data governance: PII tags can help organizations establish clear policies and procedures for handling personal data and ensure that they are being followed. This can improve data governance and reduce the risk of data breaches or privacy violations.
3. Enhanced data security: PII tags can help organizations identify and secure personal data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.
4. Improved compliance: By using PII tags, organizations can demonstrate compliance with data privacy regulations and reduce the risk of fines or other penalties.

Once you're in the data tab, you can see all the tables and columns that Secoda has identified that may contain PII data. You can select or deselect any of these columns or tables before applying the PII tag. &#x20;
