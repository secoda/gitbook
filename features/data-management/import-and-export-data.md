Once you are ready to upload your new descriptions, you can use the import descriptions button to upload your new CSV into Secoda.

If you have set up a documentation tool at your organization you can migrate your descriptions to Secoda following these steps.

1. Export descriptions to a CSV.
2. Upload descriptions to Secoda.
3. Verify descriptions.

#### 1. Export descriptions to a CSV <a href="#h_da2aba5589" id="h_da2aba5589"></a>

The import functionality only supports tables and columns currently. The CSV must have the following structure:

| **Table Name** | **Field Name** | **Description** | **Custom Property #1** | **Custom Property #2** |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| name\_1        | column\_1      | description\_1  | custom\_1\_1           | custom\_2\_1           |
| name\_2        | column\_2      | description\_2  | custom\_1\_2           | custom\_2\_2           |

Where the **Custom Property** can be any number of properties you'd like to add. If you'd like to just import table descriptions and properties, the "Field Name" column is not required.

#### 2. Upload descriptions to Secoda <a href="#h_1114a0b4bd" id="h_1114a0b4bd"></a>

Log into [Secoda](https://app.secoda.co) and go into the **Settings > Data.** Create a backup of your current descriptions, if you'd like, by clicking "Export". \*\*\*\* Click the "**Import**" button and select the `.csv` file you exported in step 1, and wait for the success message.

#### 3. Verify descriptions <a href="#h_47949f1af3" id="h_47949f1af3"></a>

Go to a data resource and confirm that the descriptions have been correctly imported. If you have any questions or issues please contact [hello@secoda.co](mailto:hello@secoda.co).
