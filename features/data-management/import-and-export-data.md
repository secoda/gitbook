Once you export your data descriptions, you can view and edit your descriptions in CSV format or Google Sheets and upload the changes to Secoda. Below is an overview of the results from exporting your data:

Once you are ready to upload your new descriptions, you can use the [import](https://help.secoda.co/en/articles/5076799-import-descriptions-properties) descriptions button to upload your new CSV into Secoda.

If you have set up a documentation tool at your organization you can migrate your descriptions to Secoda following these steps.

1. Export descriptions to a CSV.
2. Upload descriptions to Secoda.
3. Verify descriptions.

#### 1. Export descriptions to a CSV <a href="#h_da2aba5589" id="h_da2aba5589"></a>

The import functionality only supports tables and columns currently. The CSV must have the following structure:

| **Table Name** | **Field Name** | **Description** | **Custom Property** |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| name\_1        | column\_1      | description\_1  | custom\_1           |
| name\_2        | column\_2      | description\_2  | custom\_2           |

If you'd like to just import table descriptions and properties, the "Field Name" column is not required.

#### 2. Upload descriptions to Secoda <a href="#h_1114a0b4bd" id="h_1114a0b4bd"></a>

Log into [Secoda](https://app.secoda.co) and go into the **Settings > Data.** Create a backup of your current descriptions, if you'd like, by clicking "Export". \*\*\*\* Click the "**Import**" button and select the `.csv` file you exported in step 1, and wait for the success message.

#### 3. Verify descriptions <a href="#h_47949f1af3" id="h_47949f1af3"></a>

Go to a data resource and confirm that the descriptions have been correctly imported. If you have any questions or issues please contact [hello@secoda.co](mailto:hello@secoda.co).
