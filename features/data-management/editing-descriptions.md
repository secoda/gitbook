# Editing Descriptions

Secoda pulls the descriptions of tables, dashboards and columns that are available in the central source. If you integrate your YAML documentation from dbt, Secoda will automatically populate your column and table descriptions to match the YAML documentation.&#x20;

Click a column description to edit it. Of course, you can always edit the description and hit enter to save and it will become your description in Secoda. Add tags such as bookmarked, PII, approved, verified etc. on tables, columns, and dashboards, to annotate the category and status of the data asset.

When you update a column description, Secoda will utilize lineage and similar columns to notify you if there are direct inheritance on column(s) that use the same data. You can choose which columns to apply this updated description to, both upstream and downstream of the lineage chain.&#x20;
