# Assigning owners to data

## **How to assign owners to data in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

From a table page, Editors and Admins can assign Owners for individual tables by clicking the pencil icon in the grey box.

Assigning owners has a few benefits. If your data has owners, you can:

* Understand who will be affected by upstream or downstream changes to a dataset
* Get notifications when the datasets change

Assigning owners can also help you identify abandoned data sets no one currently owns, that may need to be maintained or removed.

### Being an Owner

Owners are responsible keeping documentation on their datasets up to date. If something looks off with a dataset, or a new user is looking to get acquainted with the data, they can ask questions in the questions tab.

Owners will receive notifications through email and the Secoda app when tables, columns or documentation-related changes. If you have the Secoda Slack integration installed, you will receive notifications through Slack.

Table Owners can add helpful comments or Frequently Asked Questions about a dataset so theyâ€™ll show at the top of the documentation tab.
