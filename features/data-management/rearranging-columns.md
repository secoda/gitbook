# Rearranging and Hiding Columns

## **How to rearrange and hide columns in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

To do this, go to the dataset that you'd like to rearrange. You can either search for it using the search bar, or in your left-side navigation bar.&#x20;

After you've selected the source you'd like to edit, click Rearrange.&#x20;

On this screen, you can select or de-select the columns you'd like to see on Secoda. You can also re-arrange the order of them by drag-and-dropping using the 6 dots on the right side of the screen.&#x20;
