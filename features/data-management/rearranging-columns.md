# Rearranging and Hiding Columns

Not every piece of a dataset will be relevant to your teammates who are using Secoda. You can rearrange columns in the platform to ensure that your team can find exactly what they're looking for.&#x20;

To do this, go to the dataset that you'd like to rearrange. You can either search for it using the search bar, or in your left-side navigation bar.&#x20;

After you've selected the source you'd like to edit, click Rearrange.&#x20;

On this screen, you can select or de-select the columns you'd like to see on Secoda. You can also re-arrange the order of them by drag-and-dropping using the 6 dots on the right side of the screen.&#x20;
