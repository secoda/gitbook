# Publishing Resources

You can draft various resources in Secoda (dictionary terms, collections, documents, questions) and leave them as a draft before publishing.&#x20;

To do this, select **Draft** to the right of the resource description fields. **As a draft, only the editor and workspace admins are able to view the resource.**&#x20;

To make a resource to viewble to guests and viewers, select **Publish** within the same dropdown as **Draft.**&#x20;
