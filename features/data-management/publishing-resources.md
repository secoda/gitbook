# Publishing Resources

You can draft various resources in Secoda (dictionary terms, collections, documents, questions) and leave them as a draft before publishing. To do this, select **Draft** to the right of the resource description fields. **As a draft, only the editor and workspace admins are able to view the resource.** To make a resource to viewable to guests and viewers, select **Publish** within the same dropdown as **Draft.**&#x20;
