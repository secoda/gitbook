# Documenting a resource

Each resource in Secoda has a "documentation" tab that allows editors and admins to add documentation to a resource. This documentation can help editors and admins add more content and context to a resource so viewers who are less familiar with the data can start using the resource. To start documenting, just start typing in the "documentation" tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
Try using the '/' command to add custom elements to a document. Secoda's documentation editor lets editors add embeds, files, links, tables, and many more interesting documentation formats to make data documentation more interesting.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also use the '@' command to tag resources from across your knowledge base directly within your data resources.
{% endhint %}
