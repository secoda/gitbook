# Documenting your data

Data documentation is the process of creating and maintaining documentation for data assets within an organization. This can include information such as descriptions, definitions, metadata, and data lineage information.

There are several benefits to data documentation:

1. Improved transparency: Data documentation helps to make data more transparent and understandable, making it easier for others to use and trust the data.
2. Enhanced data governance: Data documentation can help establish clear roles and responsibilities for data management and ensure that data is being used appropriately.
3. Improved collaboration: Data documentation can facilitate collaboration by making it easier for team members to understand and use data assets.
4. Enhanced data security: Data documentation can help organizations identify and protect sensitive data and ensure that it is only accessed by authorized personnel.

## **Getting Started with Documentation in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

Each resource in Secoda has a "documentation" tab that allows editors and admins to add documentation to a resource. This documentation can help editors and admins add more content and context to a resource so viewers who are less familiar with the data can start using the resource. To start documenting, just start typing in the "documentation" tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
Try using the '/' command to add custom elements to a document. Secoda's documentation editor lets editors add embeds, files, links, tables, and many more interesting documentation formats to make data documentation more interesting.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also use the '@' command to tag resources from across your knowledge base directly within your data resources.
{% endhint %}
