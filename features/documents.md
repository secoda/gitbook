# Documents

## Documents

Documents allow the data team to store **context** on collections, datasets, and tables in one place. Documents in Secoda are robust, and allow you to combine text, queries, and live charts in a notebook interface. Use this tab to find information about your organization’s data or internal processes that are not directly tied to one specific table, term, or resource. Just like the data dictionary, all documents can be found using search, and can be directly linked in other resources in the workspace.

Below are some examples of Documents use cases we see often:

* Writing process guides
* Defining KPIs
* Posting video tutorials

### Documents features and embeds

Within documents, you can tag other resources in your Secoda workspace. For example, applicable dictionary terms or collections.&#x20;

You can also use the '@' command to tag resources from across your knowledge base directly within your data resources.

Try using the '/' command to add custom elements to a document. Secoda's documentation editor lets editors add embeds, files, links, tables, and many more interesting documentation formats to make data documentation more interesting.

### Analysis Documents

A unique feature of our Documents, is that you can use them with live queries and charts. You can reference your data catalogue and data dictionary while creating robust data analysis in Secoda.&#x20;

Analysis documents are useful once you've connected your database to Secoda and given Secoda permission to query the data in the database. To learn more about how to Query in Secoda for analysis within the tool, check out the page below!

[queries](queries/)
