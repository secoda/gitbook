  Create documents in Secoda on anything that you'd like your users to have more
  context on!

# Documents

Documents in Secoda are robust, and allow you to combine text, queries, and live charts in a notebook interface. Use Documents to find information about your organization’s data or internal processes that are not directly tied to one specific table, term, or resource. Just like the dictionary, all documents can be found using search, and can be directly linked in other resources in the workspace.

Below are some examples of Documents use cases we see often:

* Writing process guides or project specs
* Documenting important queries
* Defining KPIs
* Posting video tutorials

## Documents features

* [comments.md](comments.md "mention") can be added in order to collaborate with your co-workers on your Documents.
* Use the '@' command to tag and reference other resources from across the workspace like tables or dictionary terms.
* Use the '/' command to add custom elements to a document. Add embeds, files, links, tables, and many more interesting documentation formats to make data documentation more interesting. See a whole list of [embeds.md](../embeds.md "mention").
* You can also write live [queries](../queries/ "mention") in Documents for adhoc analysis.
* Bring existing Documents from [confluence](../../integrations/productivity-tools/confluence/ "mention") into Secoda's Documents.
* Build a Table of Contents in Documents by using the / command and either scrolling or typing "Table of Contents" to insert it.&#x20;
