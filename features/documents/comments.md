# Comments

Comments in Secoda encourage collaboration between teams both in and outside of the Data team. Users can highlight text to add comments on a Document, as well as reply to and share emoji reactions to those comments. Once the thread is resolved, users can resolve the comments to hide them from the Document.

Comments will allow users to align on definitions, internal projects, task management, and much more.

### How to use Secoda Comments

1. Navigate to a Document that you'd like to collaborate on
2. Highlight text that you'd like to add a comment to by clicking and dragging over the text
3. Click the comment icon, type your comment and click the arrow to share
