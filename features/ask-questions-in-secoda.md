# Questions

## **Introduction**

Discover how our Questions feature enhances data discoverability beyond traditional metadata or metrics. This tool is designed to handle complex, nuanced questions that require personalized responses from your data team.

## **Efficient Question Management**&#x20;

Traditionally, questions to the data team are managed ad hoc via platforms like Slack and Jira. With our integrations, you can streamline this process:

* **Slack Workflow**: Integrate directly with Slack to manage questions within your usual communication channels. Learn more about the Slack integration [slack-less-than-greater-than-questions-workflow.md](../best-practices/slack-less-than-greater-than-questions-workflow.md "mention").
* **Jira Integration**: Seamlessly connect with Jira to handle data-related queries through your existing project management tools. Integrate with [jira](../integrations/productivity-tools/jira/ "mention").

## **Using Questions in Secoda**

* **Browsing Previous Questions**: Within Secoda, users can browse previously asked questions by going to the Questions homepage.&#x20;
* **Asking New Questions**: Any user can pose new questions from the Questions homepage, or by navigating to a resource and asking it from there.&#x20;
* **Assigning Owners:** Assign an Owner or Group to a question if you know who can answer; if unsure, leave that blank. Admins can automate owner assignments based on the question type. See this example for guidance [#assign-owners-to-questions](automations/automations-use-cases.md#assign-owners-to-questions "mention").
* **Answering Questions**: Once a question is posted, teammates can comment, and editors have the ability to verify or provide different answers.
* **Finalizing Answers**: Admins or Editors select the best answer, which is then marked with a green checkmark and indexed in Secodaâ€™s central search, making it easily accessible for anyone who might have similar queries in the future.

## About Questions

* **Rich Context**: Since Secoda integrates with your organization's data systems, responses can include links to relevant tables, queries, or related questions, enriching the context and utility of each answer.
* **Metadata Management**: Each question features a sidebar where users can set priorities, add the question to collections or teams, and more. Admins and editors can also delete incorrect or outdated responses.

* **Unanswered Questions**: Easily filter and view unanswered questions by sorting by status, ensuring no query goes unresolved.
