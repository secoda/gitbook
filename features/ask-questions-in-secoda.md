# Questions

There is a lot of information that isn't discoverable using metadata or metrics. Sometimes, questions to the data team are much more nuanced and require a person on the data team to answer.

Often these questions are asked and answered in an ad hoc fashion through apps like Slack and Jira, which you can integrate with our Questions feature here: [slack-less-than-greater-than-questions-workflow.md](../best-practices/slack-less-than-greater-than-questions-workflow.md "mention")[jira](../integrations/productivity-tools/jira/ "mention").

Within Secoda, you can find past questions, as well as pose a new questions to the data team. Since Secoda is connected to your organizationâ€™s data, questions and answers can include links to relevant tables, queries, or even other questions.

## About Questions

Once a question is submitted in the UI, teammates can comment on the question and editors can verify the correct answer (or provide a different answer). Once an answer has been chosen by the admin (indicated by a green checkmark), it will be indexed in the central search for any future employee who asks a similar question.

Each Question has the sidebar metadata (see below) so that the person asking the question can indicate the Priority, add it to any Collections or Teams etc. Admins and Editors can also delete incorrect answers or comments.
