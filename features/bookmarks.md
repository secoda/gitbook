# Bookmarks

To bookmark a resource, you can click the bookmark icon in the top right of any resource. When a resource is bookmarked, the icon will be highlighted black.

To access your bookmarks, you can go to your **Profile** (located in the bottom right of the app). From here, click **Bookmarks**. Another way to easily access your Bookmarks is to add them to your [Personal homepage](custom-homepage.md). The filters in the widgets allow you to filter for "Bookmarked".
