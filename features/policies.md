* Define and enforce data governance rules
* Monitor compliance across your data resources
* Track and remediate policy violations
* Ensure data quality and security standards

1. Navigate to the Policies page
2. Click the "Add Policy" button
3. Define your policy details:
   * Name: Give your policy a descriptive name
   * Icon: Choose an icon to represent your policy (optional)
   * Description: Explain the purpose and requirements of your policy

### Policy Components
