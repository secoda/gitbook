Policies in Secoda help organizations enforce data governance rules and maintain compliance across their data stack. With policies, teams can monitor, validate, and enforce data standards systematically.

### Overview

Policies provide a structured way to:

* Define and enforce data governance rules
* Monitor compliance across your data resources
* Track and remediate policy violations
* Ensure data quality and security standards

### Examples of Policies

1. **Classification Tagging**\
   Ensures all resources are labeled with a sensitivity classification (e.g., PII, PHI, Confidential) to support data governance, access control, and compliance.
2. **Retention Period Enforcement**\
   Requires that sensitive data assets (like PII or Confidential data) have a defined retention period to manage data lifecycle and meet regulatory requirements.
3. **Encryption of Sensitive Data**\
   Mandates that tables containing sensitive or classified data are encrypted to protect against unauthorized access and align with security standards.

### Creating Policies

To create a new policy:

1. Navigate to the Policies page
2. Click the "Add Policy" button
3. Define your policy details:
   * Name: Give your policy a descriptive name
   * Icon: Choose an icon to represent your policy (optional)
   * Description: Explain the purpose and requirements of your policy
4. Add filters for resources that are governed by the policy, e.g., Snowflake production table
5. Add conditions that must be met by the resources, e.g., Has owner

### Managing Issues

Policy issues are flagged resources that do not meet the conditions defined in your policies. For example, if you have a policy requiring all tables with PII to be encrypted and a table is not encrypted, Secoda will surface that as a policy issue. These issues help you identify gaps in governance, security, or documentation so you can take corrective action.

#### How to Manage Policy Issues

1. **View Issues**\
   Each policy has an "Issues" tab that lists all non-compliant resources. You can filter and sort these to focus on specific teams, systems, or classifications.
2. **Investigate Context**\
   Click into an issue to view detailed metadata, related documentation, lineage, and ownership. This helps you understand why the issue exists and what needs to be fixed.
3. **Remediate or Assign**
   * Update metadata directly in Secoda (e.g., add a missing classification or owner).
   * Assign the issue to the correct stakeholder for follow-up.
   * Link the issue to external system such as Jira ticket or external task for tracking.
4. **Mark as Resolved**\
   Once the resource complies with the policy, the issue is automatically removed from the active list. No manual resolution steps are needed.

### Automations with Policies

\
[automations.md](automations.md "mention") in Secoda allow you to automatically remediate policy issues by updating metadata directly when certain conditions are met. When a policy is tied to metadata—such as classification, owner, or retention period—you can use automations to bring non-compliant resources back into alignment without manual intervention.

When a policy is associated with structured metadata—such as classifications, owners, or descriptions—Secoda allows you to create an automation directly from the policy screen. This helps streamline setup by pre-filling relevant conditions and actions based on the policy definition.
