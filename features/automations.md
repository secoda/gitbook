# Automations

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is currently in beta testing. If you'd like early access to testing out these features, and help inform our improvements to it, you can sign up at [this link](https://www.secoda.co/blog/early-access-secoda-automations).
{% endhint %}

Users can create rule-based automations at scale and update metadata and documentation in bulk. This Zapier-like feature will save your team an invaluable amount of time!

You can update the following resource metadata using Automations:

* Tags
* Owners

{% hint style="info" %}
This list will expand over time, to eventually automate all the editable metadata that is included as part of your resource documentation.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Creating an Automation

#### Step 1: Create a new Automation in Secoda

1. Find and click into Automations in the left side bar under Monitors.
2.  Click Add Automation, which will open a new automation template for you to fill out.&#x20;

3. The default title will be "New Automation". Enter a new title describing the task to be accomplished, for example "Update tags".

#### Step 2: Set up rules as filters

1. For each filter you'd like to add, select **Add Filter** and add the metadata you'd like to filter for. Currently, these options are for Tag and Owner.&#x20;
2. Next, you must define how you'd like to filter on this metadata. Should it be an exact match, contain a term, etc.
3. If you have more than one filter, click the blue **all** button to choose either **all** or **any**. **All** will implement `AND` logic among the filters, while  **any** will logically `OR` the criteria.

#### Step 3: Select the actions to be performed based on the rules above

1. Select Add Property and add which properties you'd like to be updated with the automation. The editable properties through Automation are currently Owner and Tag, but this list will expand.
2. To set a matching condition for the filters, click the blue **self** button to select which resources you'd like to be edited with the automation. These can be the same resources defined in the previous steps (self), their children resources (child) or their parent resources (parent).
3. Choose whether or not you'd like to Override existing metadata with these actions, using the check box :ballot\_box\_with\_check:.

#### Step 4: Run the Automation

1. Under the **Actions** drop down, you can click Turn on or Delete.
2. Configure the scheduling so that this Automation runs on a set cadence. Automations can run hourly, daily or weekly.

## Example Automation

In the example below, you'll see an Automation that automatically updates the children of resources that are tagged with a "Warning" tag, with that same tag. This will be super time-saving with tables and columns, for example. If I bring in tables that already have a set tag, but the columns within do not yet, this automation will identify those columns and automatically tag them for me.
