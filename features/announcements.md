# Announcements

Using Announcements, data teams can send messages to their users within Secoda.

Users have the ability to send Announcements directly from the [Inbox](data-inbox.md) in Secoda, by clicking "New announcement".

Users can choose where they receive these announcements (in-app, Slack, or email) by going to their personal [Notifications settings](notifications.md).

Users can also share an announcement _from any resource_. For example, if your announcement pertains to a table, you can click into that table and find the megaphone button in the side panel to create an Announcement.

One main use case for this feature is sharing with your organization when new dashboards or tables have been introduced.
