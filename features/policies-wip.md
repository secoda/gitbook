# Policies \[WIP]

### Introduction[​](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#introduction) <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Secoda provides the ability to declare fine-grained access control Policies. A few examples of policies are

* Dataset Owners should be allowed to edit documentation, but not Tags.
* Jenny, our Data Steward, should be allowed to edit Tags for any Dashboard, but no other metadata.
* James, a Data Analyst, should be allowed to edit the Related Resources for a specific Data Pipeline he is a downstream consumer of.
* The Data Platform team should be allowed to manage users & groups, view platform analytics, & manage policies themselves.

{% hint style="info" %}
Policies are only enabled for Premium and Enterprise tiers.
{% endhint %}

### What is a Policy?[​](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#what-is-a-policy) <a href="#what-is-a-policy" id="what-is-a-policy"></a>

All policies consist of privileges (see all privileges below) and are applied to Roles to be associated with users. There are 2 types of Policies within Secoda:

1. Platform Policies
2. Resource Policies

#### Platform Policies[​](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#platform-policies) <a href="#platform-policies" id="platform-policies"></a>

**Platform** policies determine who has platform-level privileges on Secoda. Examples of these privileges include

* Managing Users & Groups
* Viewing the Secoda Analytics
* Managing Policies&#x20;

Platform policies consist of just privileges, e.g, "Can view Analytics". Platform policies do not include a specific "target resource" against which the Policies apply. Instead, they simply serve to assign specific privileges.

#### Resource Policies[​](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#metadata-policies) <a href="#metadata-policies" id="metadata-policies"></a>

**Resource** policies determine who can do what to which Resources. For example,

* Who can edit Tables Documentation & Related Resources?
* Who can add Owners to a Chart?
* Who can add Tags to a Dashboard?

A Metadata Policy can be broken down into 2 parts:

1. **Resources**: The _which_. Resources that the policy applies to, e.g. "All Tables".
2. **Privileges**: The _what_. What actions are being permitted by a policy, e.g. "Add Tags".

**Resources**[**​**](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#resources)

Subsets of resources can be associated with the policy by leveraging [filters.md](filters.md "mention"). This uses the same capabilities that the filters in search, catalog, and many places in the application uses. Some examples of filters include:

1. Resources from a specific integration, e.g, Snowflake
2. Resources of a specific type, e.g, Tables
3. Resources that contain a specific tag
4. Resources that are marked as PII

**Privileges**[**​**](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#privileges)

Check out the full list of privileges below.&#x20;

### Managing Policies[​](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#managing-policies) <a href="#managing-policies" id="managing-policies"></a>

Policies can be managed on the page **Settings > Members > Policies** tab. The `Policies` tab will only be visible to those users having the `Manage Policies` privilege.

Out of the box, Secoda is deployed with a set of default Policies. The set of default policies are Viewers, Editors, and Admins.

### Privileges[​](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#reference) \[WIP] <a href="#reference" id="reference"></a>

#### Platform-level privileges[​](https://datahubproject.io/docs/authorization/policies#platform-level-privileges) <a href="#platform-level-privileges" id="platform-level-privileges"></a>

These privileges are for Secoda operators to access & manage the administrative functionality of the system.
