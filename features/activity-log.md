# Activity Log

The Activity Log shows the history of activity on each resource. This includes when it was created, when it's metadata has been edited, when users have requested access to it etc. This can show you what different users have worked on in Secoda and helps to track down changes over time.

Simply click on the three dot menu in the Properties sidebar on the top right-hand corner of the resource, and select **Activity Log**.
