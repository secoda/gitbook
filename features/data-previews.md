# Data Previews

## Dashboard previews

{% hint style="info" %}
Permissions from the Source will persist in Secoda. If you don't have access to the dashboard, then you won't be able to see the preview in Secoda.
{% endhint %}

Users are able to preview BI dashboards and visualizations directly in Secoda. We support this feature for many of our supported visualization tools like Looker, Tableau, and Sigma. Check out the Metadata extracted docs (sub-pages of each of the [Data Visualization Tools](https://docs.secoda.co/integrations/data-visualization-tools) docs) to see if we support this feature for your BI tool.

These previews are in fullscreen and can be found under the "Preview" tab of the resource.
