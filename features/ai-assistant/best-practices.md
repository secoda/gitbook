# Best Practices

When interacting with the Secoda AI Assistant, here are some ways to make the most of the tool:

1. Start new chats every 3-4 questions to ensure that the AI is able to keep up with the data provided. New chats can be started through the right side panel.
2. Reference specific resources in your prompt.&#x20;
3. Focus on succinct questions. Obscure prompts about the metadata, or long winded questions do not provide great results.
4. Questions about the actual content of the data, that isn't referenced in the metadata or documentation, will not provide useful results. This is because the data itself is not being sent to OpenAI.

Don't just take our word for it! Ask the tool itself :wink:
