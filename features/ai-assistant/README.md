## Overview

Secoda's AI Assistant can be thought of as ChatGPT for your data stack. Using a chat interface, it lets anyone at your company get an answer to a data question, regardless of technical ability.

Secoda's AI Assistant is powered by [OpenAI's APIs](https://openai.com/product), which sit atop the GPT4 Large Language Model. We are updated to the latest version of GPT -- GPT4 Turbo.&#x20;

By sharing **only** the metadata in your workspace with OpenAI, Secoda's AI Assistant can help you with documentation, query building, locating institutional knowledge, and more!

## Set Up

By default, the AI Assistant is off. To toggle it on, you must go into your [Workspace General Settings](https://app.secoda.co/settings/workspace), and scroll down to find the AI section.

Once the AI Search is enabled, you'll see the AI Assistant in the left hand menu.
