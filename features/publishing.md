# Publishing data portal

## **Getting Started with Publishing Data** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

As an editor, you're going to have access to all resources in Secoda. As a viewer or guest, you will only be able to view the resources that have been published by the editors or admins in your workspace.&#x20;

This functionality is built into Secoda to ensure that only the tables, docs, terms and questions that are relevant and documented are available for consumption. As an editor, you can mimic what a viewer will see in Secoda by toggling the viewer mode button in the bottom left hand corner.

Once toggled, you'll be able to see the viewer experiance in Secoda. As a viewer, you only get access to the published collections, docs, dictionary terms and questions that have been shared with you.&#x20;

Each resource type has the ability to be marked as published or to remain in draft mode. This toggle is configurable by admins and editors and can be found by clicking on the dictionary, questions, data or docs pages in Secoda.
