# Pinning to Homepage

****

You can pin a collection to the home page by clicking the three buttons in the top right hand side of the collections folder. You can also add documentation to a collection to guide different employees towards the resources they should be seeing (pictured below).

Here are a few ideas of what you can do with collections:

* Create a collection for specific departments
* Create a “Home” collection for the entire company to see key metrics
* Create a “Investor” collection for data shared with investors
* Create an “onboarding” collection to help new employees learn about the key data across the company
