# Pinning to Homepage

## **How to pin collections to your homepage** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

You can pin a collection to the home page by clicking the three buttons in the top right hand side of the collections folder. You can also add documentation to a collection to guide different employees towards the resources they should be seeing when they first come onto Secoda.

Here are a few ideas of what you can do with collections:

* Create a collection for specific departments
* Create a “Home” collection for the entire company to see key metrics
* Create an “Investor” collection for data shared with investors
* Create an “onboarding” collection to help new employees learn about the key data across the company
