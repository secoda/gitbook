# Pinning to Homepage

## **How to pin collections to your homepage** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

You can pin a collection to the home page by clicking the three buttons in the top right hand side of the collections folder. You can also add documentation to a collection to guide different employees towards the resources they should be seeing when they first come onto Secoda.
