# Adding Resources

To add resources to a collection, either create a **New Collection** or click on the collection that you'd like to add to.&#x20;

From here, you'll be able to add resources from within Secoda, run a live query, or add resources from a number of integrations. You'll also be able to see how many resources are connected to that collection from the **Collections** overview page.&#x20;

You can view the different types of resources that are connected by toggling between the tabs on the top of the resource.&#x20;
