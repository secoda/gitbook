  In Secoda, teams can organize their resources using a few different tools we
  provide editors. One of these tools is the ability to create collections of
  resources.

# Collections

You can create Collections on Secoda which allows you to group various resources together and document them. Collections are a revamped version of the tags, so the mechanism for adding a resource to a collection is that same as tagging. You can also pin collections to the home page for easier discoverability.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend creating collections per team, group, or function. For example, a "Marketing" collection, or a "Finance" collection.
{% endhint %}
