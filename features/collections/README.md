# Collections

In Secoda, teams can organize their resources using a few different tools we provide editors. One of these tools is the ability to create collections of resources. You can create collections for anything such as specific teams to make it easier for people to find the right information. Collections are a revamped version of the tags, so the mechanism for adding a resource to a collection is that same as tagging. You can also pin collections to the home page for easier discoverability.
