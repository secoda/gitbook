Monitoring is an essential player in maintaining data quality. Within Secoda, you can configure essential monitors to be alerted about changes to your data. Automatically schedule and create thresholds with the ability to track the history of runs and visualize performance of your monitors.

Choose from the following monitor types:

* **Nullness** - The percentage of null values
* **Cardinality** - The relationship between rows of one table and rows in another
* **Uniqueness** - Data duplication
* **Row Count** - The count of rows
* **Maximum** - The maximum value
* **Mean** - The average value
* **Minimum** - The minimum value
