Monitoring is an essential player in maintaining data quality. Within Secoda, you can configure essential monitors to be alerted about changes to your data. Automatically schedule and create thresholds with the ability to track the history of runs and visualize performance of your monitors.

Choose from the following monitor types:

* **Nullness** - The percentage of values in a column that are null
* **Cardinality** - The number of distinct values of a given column
* **Uniqueness** - The percentage of values in a column that are unique
* **Freshness** - The time elapsed since last update
* **Row Count** - The number of rows over time
* **Maximum** - The highest value of a numeric column
* **Mean** - The arithmetic mean of a numeric column
* **Minimum** - The lowest value of a numeric column

The monitor will alert if any of these values are higher or lower than expected.

## How to create monitors

6. Click into the monitor to further edit and see the history of the monitor's runs
   * Edit Configuration details like Schedule, Threshold and Sensitivity&#x20;
     * Schedule - Choose between Daily, Every 12, 6 or 3 hours, or Hourly

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: You can only add a monitor type which each of the columns support.

For example, if you have 3 numeric columns selected, you can add a "MIN" or "MAX" monitor, but you cannot do it if even one string column is selected in the modal.

The lighter green surrounding the main line represent the threshold limits - once the threshold is passed, it'll show a red dot indicating an incident

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Kapture 2023-09-21 at 12.13.04.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Scroll down to see Run history, and filter for triggered Incident Reports. Here you can see any Downstream Resources that may be impacted by the incident.

You can either Acknowledge or Resolve the incident by click these buttons below. The incident will be automatically resolved if the numbers go back into a good state (within the threshold).

## Monitoring notifications

Ensure that you receive notifications about your monitors by going into your Notification settings. Check off where you'd like to be notified, whether that's in Slack, by email, and/or in the app.
