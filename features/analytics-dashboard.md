# Analytics Dashboard

Admins have access to the Analytics dashboard which showcases how their Secoda workspace is being used. They also receive a weekly email that highlights the metrics in this analytics dashboard.&#x20;

Some metrics that are tracked include:

* Monthly, Weekly and Daily active users
* Popular resources and searches
* Top editors and viewers

This feature is located above Settings in the left side panel.&#x20;

You are also able to filter on the metrics in the dashboard. In the gif below, you can see how to filter on "Popular resources" to show the most popular _dashboards_ for example!

Another important metric you can filter for here is **undocumented popular resources**. This would be an important metric to know about so that you can make sure to build out the documentation since your users are often visiting these resources.&#x20;

Reach out to us if there are other metrics that you'd like to see in this dashboard!
