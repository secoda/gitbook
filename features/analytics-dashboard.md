# Analytics Dashboard

Admins have access to the Analytics dashboard which showcases how their Secoda workspace is being used. They also receive a weekly email that highlights the metrics in this analytics dashboard.&#x20;

Some metrics that are tracked include:

* Monthly, Weekly and Daily active users
* Popular resources and searches
* Top editors and viewers

This feature is located above Settings in the left side panel. Reach out to us if there are other metrics that you'd like to see in this dashboard!
