# Analytics Dashboard

Admins have access to the Analytics dashboard which showcases how their Secoda workspace is being used. They also receive a weekly email that highlights the metrics in this analytics dashboard.

Some metrics that are tracked include:

* Monthly, Weekly and Daily active users
* Popular resources and searches
* Top editors and viewers
* Integration-specific: Snowflake costs, dbt tests, dbt runs

This feature is located above Settings in the left side panel.

## Reports

Create Reports to organize your Analytics widgets into separate themes. For example, you can have one Report that shows stats on your users, another on documentation, and another on Snowflake costs.

## Filtering the dashboard

You are able to filter on the metrics in the dashboard. In the gif below, you can see how to filter on "Popular resources" to show the most popular _dashboards_ for example!

## Identifying undocumented resources

Another important metric you can filter for here is **undocumented popular resources**. This would be an important metric to know about so that you can make sure to build out the documentation since your users are often visiting these resources.

## Snowflake costs

You're able to see how your Snowflake costs have changed over time with this widget.

### Monitor Snowflake costs

You can even use our monitoring features on a Snowflake cost widget to be alerted about changes to daily costs. Simply create the widget, then use the three dot menu to create a monitor.

Add filters on usage type and balance source, and voila! You can catch changes before they become larger issues.
