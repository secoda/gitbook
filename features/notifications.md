# Notifications

## **How to manage notifications in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

Viewers, editors, and admins can change their notification settings by going to **Settings -> Notifications.**&#x20;

You can change how often you receive these notifications, where you'll receive the notifications and which kinds of notifications you'll receive.&#x20;

#### Subscriptions

Each resource has a list of subscribers which can be found on the bottom right side of a resource. As an admin you subscribe team members to get notifications for updates on a resource. An update can include changes to any of the metadata such as the description, documentation, ownership, collections, and tags. A viewer can subscribe themselves to a resource but cannot modify the subscription list of any other users.

#### Secoda Digest

Secoda will also send a report on a weekly basis with your workspace analytics and the key actions in the workspace from the past week.
