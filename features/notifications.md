# Notifications

## **Manage notifications in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

Viewers, editors, and admins can change their notification settings by going to **Settings -> Notifications.**

You can change how often you receive these notifications, where you'll receive the notifications and which kinds of notifications you'll receive.

One of the more important notification types that you might consider configuring are **notifications for schema changes**. These will alert data owners & subscribers when new columns are added to the schema, and therefore are ready to be documented within Secoda. Set these up in Settings by going to Notifications > Extractions > Table schema changed.

### In-App Notifications

In-app notifications will go to your Inbox. Read more about that feature here [data-inbox.md](data-inbox.md "mention").

### Email Notifications

Email notifications are sent to the email that are associated with your Secoda account.

### Slack Notifications

Read up on how to configure your notifications to be sent to Slack here [#slack-notifications](../integrations/productivity-tools/slack-connection/#slack-notifications "mention").

## Subscribe to resource changes

Each resource has a list of subscribers which can be found on the bottom right side of a resource. As an admin, you can subscribe team members to get notifications for updates on a resource. An update can include changes to any of the metadata such as the description, documentation, ownership, collections, and tags. A viewer can subscribe themselves to a resource but cannot modify the subscription list of any other users.
