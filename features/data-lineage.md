# Data Lineage

Secoda automatically extracts queries to generate data lineage. This can help data teams identify the downstream and upstream dependencies of a table easily.&#x20;

On each dependency, you will be able to see how many levels away a particular table is.&#x20;

1. Select the data asset that you'd like to view the lineage of from the Data button in the navigation bar, or, search for it using the search bar.&#x20;
2. After selecting the asset you'd like to view, click on the **Lineage** tab. You'll find a visual demonstration of your data lineage here, and can zoom in, out, and select what lineage detail you'd like to view on the right side.&#x20;

To view the dependencies of a table, click **Downstream** on the top tabs.&#x20;

You'll be able to sort the dependencies of that table by source, name, resource type, and schema by typing the name of what you'd like to sort by.&#x20;
