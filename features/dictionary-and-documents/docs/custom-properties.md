# Adding Properties to a Doc

## How to Add Properties to a Doc

To create a custom property in a document, click **Add a Property**, below the static fields in the document.&#x20;

Enter the name for the property and the description/label. This custom property will only apply to the current document that you're editing.&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Group 593.png>)

To delete a custom property, click on the name of the property, then click **Delete**.&#x20;

<div align="left">

</div>

Custom properties can be used to identify alternative names for terms or collections. These properties will get picked up in the search.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a term like "MRR" adding a custom property called "Also known as" and adding all the alternative names of a term will index those names when someone searches for "monthly reccuring revenue" or "monthly sales"&#x20;
{% endhint %}
