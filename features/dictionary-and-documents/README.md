# Dictionary & Documents

## Dictionary

The Dictionary is where you can define terms that are relevant to your organization. All documented terms are accessible via Secoda’s Search, and can be referenced in other resources in your workspace. It’s an especially helpful space for newer employees getting acquainted with the company or their role.

Some common use cases for dictionary terms are defined metrics and company specific jargon. The overall goal of a dictionary is to get everyone in your organization speaking the same language.

It's simple to create Dictionary terms! See the video below walking you through the steps, where we even added the term to a specific Collection and added a Tag. Once it's created, you're able to add additional metadata like related resources.

## Documents

Documents allow the data team to store **context** on collections, datasets, and tables in one place. Documents in Secoda are robust, and allow you to combine text, queries, and live charts in a notebook interface. Use this tab to find information about your organization’s data or internal processes that are not directly tied to one specific table, term, or resource. Just like the data dictionary, all documents can be found using search, and can be directly linked in other resources in the workspace.

Below are some examples of Documents use cases we see often:

* Writing process guides
* Defining KPIs
* Posting video tutorials

### Documents features and embeds

Within documents, you can tag other resources in your Secoda workspace. For example, applicable dictionary terms or collections.&#x20;

You can also use the '@' command to tag resources from across your knowledge base directly within your data resources.

Try using the '/' command to add custom elements to a document. Secoda's documentation editor lets editors add embeds, files, links, tables, and many more interesting documentation formats to make data documentation more interesting.
