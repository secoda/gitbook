# Tool Migrations Using Secoda

## Introduction

Migrating tools within your technology stack can be challenging, especially when ensuring continuity and data integrity. Secoda provides a robust platform that supports smooth transitions by allowing you to handle migrations without losing critical information or disrupting existing workflows. Here’s a guide on how to leverage Secoda effectively during tool migrations.

## Case Study Reference

Before starting your migration, it might be helpful to learn from others who have successfully managed similar transitions. We recommend reviewing our case study on a customer’s experience with tool migration: [Textus Tool Migration Case Study](https://www.secoda.co/customers/textus-case-study). This case study provides valuable insights into managing the transition effectively using Secoda.

## Migration Strategy

#### 1. Maintain Both Tools During Transition

* **Dual Integration**: Initially, keep both the legacy and the new tool integrated within Secoda. This approach prevents any loss of dependencies and maintains data continuity throughout the migration phase.

#### 2. Documentation and Lineage

* **Transfer Documentation**: Utilize Secoda’s ability to seamlessly transfer documentation from the legacy tool to the new one. This not only saves time but also helps maintain the consistency and accuracy of data documentation across platforms. Use [automations.md](../features/automations.md "mention") to propagate the existing documentation to the new sources with the same names.
* **Visualize Changes**: Take advantage of Secoda’s visualization tools to view [lineage](../features/data-lineage.md) and compare the old and new setups side by side. This helps in understanding the impact of the transition and assists in validating the migration process.

#### 3. Completing the Migration

* **Remove Legacy Integration**: Once you are confident that the new tool is fully functional and all necessary data has been migrated successfully, you can safely remove the integration of the legacy tool from Secoda. This final step helps in decluttering the workspace and focusing on the new tool.

## Benefits of Using Secoda for Tool Migrations

* **Continuity and Integrity**: Ensures that all dependencies are preserved during the transition, thereby maintaining the integrity and continuity of data.
* **Efficiency**: Reduces the manual effort required in transferring documentation and other metadata, making the migration process more efficient.
* **Clarity and Oversight**: Provides clear visibility into both old and new setups during the transition, which helps in better decision-making and reduces the risk of errors.

## Conclusion

Tool migrations are complex but planning with the right strategies and tools like Secoda can simplify the process. By following these best practices, you can ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to your operations.
