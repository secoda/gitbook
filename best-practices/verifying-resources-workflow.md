# Defining resources workflow

## Introduction

Defining resources accurately and consistently is essential for effective data governance. This workflow is designed to guide teams in properly defining any type of resource, such as metrics, business terms, documents, and tables, ensuring they meet our organizational standards for accuracy and reliability.

Secoda users can utilize the Questions feature in the UI to align on defining resources. This document outlines the best practices that we've seen work best when identifying and defining resources, then marking them as [Verified](../resource-and-metadata-management/tags/verified-tag.md).

## Workflow Overview

1. **Initiate a Question**:

Initiate the process by creating a [Question](../features/ask-questions-in-secoda.md) in the UI about the resource you wish to define. This could be a metric, a business term, a document, or any other data resource. For example:

* Metric: "How do we define and calculate this metric?"
* Dictionary term: "What does this term mean within our context?"
* Document: "What are the usage guidelines for this document?"
* Catalog resource: "Which version of this data is most accurate and up-to-date?"

2. **Collaboration and Discussion**:

Engage relevant stakeholders by tagging them in the comment section of the question. Facilitate a discussion where all parties can contribute their insights and knowledge.

3. **Consensus**:

Reach a consensus based on the discussion and mark the definition as the correct Answer.&#x20;

4. **Resource Creation**:

Formalize the definition by creating or updating the resource with the agreed-upon definition or other metadata.&#x20;

5. **Linking to Documentation**:

Link the discussion from the Questions feature to the resource as a [Related resource](../resource-and-metadata-management/relating-resources.md) for auditing capabilities. This linkage serves as a historical record of the decision-making process.

## Verification of Defined Resources

After a resource is defined, it can be marked as Verified to further assure its reliability:

* **Verification Process**: Tag the resource as 'Verified' to indicate that it has undergone a thorough review process and is deemed a reliable source of truth.
* **Importance of Verification**: This tag helps end-users understand that the resource is not only defined but also validated by the team, reflecting a significant investment in ensuring its accuracy and relevance.

By following this workflow, we ensure that our resources are not only defined with precision but also verified for their trustworthiness, enhancing the overall data governance across the organization.
