# Verifying resources workflow

Verifying resources is an important step to address data governance goals at your organization. Verifying a resource gives end-users the confidence that they're using the best source for their work. All types of resources can be tagged as verified including metrics, dictionary terms, documents, tables et.c

Secoda users can utilize the Questions feature in the UI to align on Verified resources. This document outlines the best practices that we've seen work best when identifying and defining Verified resources.

1. Create a Question regarding a resource that you'd like to be Verified. The following examples show how you might ask a question about different types of resources:
   * **Metric**: How do we define and calculate _this metric_?
   * **Dictionary term**: How do we define _this term_?
   * **Document**: What are _the best practices_ for using this dashboard?
   * **Catalog resource** (table, schema etc.): _Which table_ is the most accurate representation, and most up to date?
2. Tag the relevant users who should have a say in answering the question, in the comment section.
3. Everyone in the thread contributes their notes and comes to a conclusion.
4. Create or identify the resource, add the appropriate metadata (description, owner, tags etc.) and tag it as Verified to indicate to users that they should trust this as the source of truth.
5. Link the Question as a [Related resource ](../../resource-and-metadata-management/relating-resources.md)for auditing capabilities and tracking how the group came to the decision.
