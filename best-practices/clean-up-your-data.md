# Clean up your data

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you check the [lineage graph](../features/data-lineage.md) in Secoda before deprecating a resource in the source!
{% endhint %}

Secoda has built in tools that allows you to clean up your data resources.

End result:

* Reduced time identifying this data manually
* Improved data quality and security
* Improved productivity for analysts trying to find the right data
* Reduced costs on data storage

## Features for cleaning up your data

### [popularity.md](../features/popularity.md "mention")

* Popularity metadata is another important metric for understanding what could be deprecated.&#x20;
* Sort the Catalog by Popularity to find unused resources with minimal views or queries.

## [automations.md](../features/automations.md "mention")

* Create an Automation to automatically tag resources as Stale if they haven't been queried or edited recently.&#x20;
* Then just filter the Catalog for Stale sources to bulk deprecate them!
