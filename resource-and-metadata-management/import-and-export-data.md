# Import and Export Metadata



{% hint style="info" %}
If you are hoping to bring in net new resources from an Integration without connecting the integration in the App, you'll need to use the [Custom Integrations](../integrations/custom-integration/) feature. If you are looking to edit existing resources, dictionary terms, documents, etc, you're in the right place!

### E**xport metadata from Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

To export data descriptions out of Secoda, you can go to the [import settings](https://app.secoda.co/settings/import) in **Settings â†’ Import & Export** data. Below is the screenshot for the settings. When exporting you can choose the type of resource you'd like to export. After clicking the export button, an **Artifact** will be prepared with your resources. Once it's prepared click the "Download Artifact" button.

Once you are ready to upload your new metadata, you can use the import button to upload your new CSV into Secoda.

### **Importing metadata into Secoda**

If you have set up a documentation tool (Excel, G-Sheet etc.) at your organization, you can migrate your metadata to Secoda following these steps.

1. Prepare your CSV
2. Update metadata in CSV
3. Import metadata to Secoda

#### 1. Prepare your CSV <a href="#h_da2aba5589" id="h_da2aba5589"></a>

You can either export your data from Secoda to a CSV, use the template linked below, or create your own CSV using the guidance provided. The file must be in CSV format.

{% file src="https://secoda-public-media-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/301663b6-9811-4577-b7bc-16a88733fe75.csv" %}
A CSV file with the headings for importing into Secoda.
{% endfile %}

* The file must have the following **required** columns:
  * **id -** Leave this blank if it's a new resource (i.e dictionary term)
  * **title -** The name of the resource
  * **entity\_type** - Can be any of the following - table, column, dashboard, chart, job, dictionary\_term, document, collection, question, or event
* The file can have the following **optional** columns:
  * **description** - This is one-liner description of the resource
  * **definition** - Mark down friendly documentation of the resource
  * **pii** - This is the [Governance](../best-practices/data-governance.md) tag and can be set to TRUE, FALSE
  * **verified -** This is the [Verified](tags/verified-tag.md) tag and can be set to TRUE, FALSE
  * **published -** This is the published status and can be set to TRUE, FALSE
  * **collections -** List of associated collection names, i.e \['Marketing', 'Engineering']
  * **owners** - List of associated owner emails, i.e, \['andrew@secoda.co', 'etai@secoda.co']. The emails should correspond to existing users or service accounts in Secoda
  * **tags -** List of associated tag names, i.e, \['production']
  * **property** - This heading is a placeholder for any custom properties you'd like to add to the resource. Please remove it if you don't plan on any custom properties for your resource. To customize it, replace **property** with the name of your custom property and add the values of that property to the relevant rows. If you'd like to add several custom properties, add a new column for each one, with the name of the custom property as the column heading.&#x20;

#### 2. Upload metadata to Secoda <a href="#h_1114a0b4bd" id="h_1114a0b4bd"></a>
