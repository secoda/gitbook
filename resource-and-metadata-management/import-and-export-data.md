{% hint style="info" %}
If your goal is to introduce net new resources from an integration without connecting the integration in the app, you should utilize the  [Custom Integrations](../integrations/custom-integrations-and-marketplace/custom-integration/) feature. If you are looking to edit existing resources, such as dictionary terms, documents, etc., the following instructions will guide you through the process.&#x20;

## Preparing Your CSV for Import

Before importing new or updated metadata into Secoda:

1. **Edit Your CSV:** After exporting, you can edit your descriptions and other properties in CSV format or Google Sheets.
2. **Set Up Your CSV:** Use the exported data as a base, the provided template in the UI, or create your own CSV adhering to the required structure:

**Required Columns:**

* **id:** Leave this blank for new resources.
* **title:** The name of the resource.
* **entity\_type:** Possible values include table, column, dashboard, chart, job, dictionary\_term, document, collection, question, or event.

**Optional Columns:**

* **description:** A brief description of the resource.
* **definition:** Markdown-friendly documentation of the resource.
* **pii:** Governance tag (TRUE or FALSE).
* **verified:** Verified status (TRUE or FALSE).
* **published:** Published status (TRUE or FALSE).
* **collections:** List of associated collection names, e.g., \['Marketing', 'Engineering'].
* **owners:** List of associated owner emails that should correspond to existing users in Secoda, e.g., \['brittany@secoda.co'].
* **tags:** List of associated tag names, e.g., \['production'].
* **custom properties:** If applicable, replace 'property' with the name of your custom property and add values accordingly. Add separate columns for multiple custom properties. Please remove it if you don't plan on adding any custom properties for your resource.
