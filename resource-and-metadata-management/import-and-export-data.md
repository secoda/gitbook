# Import and Export Resources

## Overview

This guide provides a step-by-step process for exporting and importing metadata using CSV files in Secoda. This allows for bulk editing and updating of metadata to ensure consistency and prevent duplication across your data resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your goal is to introduce net new resources from an integration without connecting the integration in the app, you should utilize the  [Custom Integrations](../integrations/custom-integrations-and-marketplace/custom-integration/) feature. If you are looking to edit existing resources, such as dictionary terms, documents, etc., the following instructions will guide you through the process.&#x20;
