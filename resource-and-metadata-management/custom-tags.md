# Custom Tags

## What are Tags?

Tags are a static way to label Resources with useful context that other users in your workspace need to know. Secoda has two built-in default tags, [auto-pii-tagging.md](../features/data-governance/auto-pii-tagging.md "mention") and [verified-tag.md](../features/data-governance/verified-tag.md "mention"). To add additional tags to your workspace, you can create custom tags based on how you'd like to categorize data in your organization.

## How to Create Custom Tags

1. Navigate to Workspace settings by clicking the `Settings` tab in the sidebar
2. Under Workspace settings, select `Tags`
3. Click the `Create tag` button to create a new tag
4. Enter Name, Tag Description, and choose a logo and color to represent the tag

## Use cases

Tags are mainly used for categorization purposes, opposed to Collections which are like folders. Many customers use tags to differentiate between types of data. Some common examples:

* "Production" vs. "Test"
* Business-Related
  * "SOPs" - Standard operating procedures
  * "Critical Data" - Business critical data elements
  * "Key Account" - High-priority important accounts
* Certificates (to be more specific with the Verified Identifier tag)
  * "Verified" - The resource and its metadata is accepted and approved by the business and ready to be used
  * "In review" - The owner or stakeholders are reviewing the resource
  * "Draft" - Resource is pending, work in progress, may have some issues
  * "Deprecated" - Should not be used, is outdated or stale
* Security classifications (to be more specific with the PII Identifier tag)
  * Confidential
  * Restricted
  * Public

## Bulk Tagging

There are a few ways that you can tag your resources in bulk. Use the [bulk-editing-resources.md](editing-metadata/bulk-editing-resources.md "mention") feature to drag a Tag down to add it to multiple resources at once (similar to the click and drag feature in Excel and G-Sheets).

You can also bulk tag using our [propagating-metadata.md](editing-metadata/propagating-metadata.md "mention") feature. If there's a tag that you'd like to propagate to other resources with the same or similar name, or in the resource's downstream lineage, you can do so using this feature.

## Deleting Tags

You can delete a Custom Tag by clicking **Delete** on the same Settings page. Since this action can't be undone within the UI, you will receive a warning before you confirm that you'd like to delete the tag.

## Filtering for Tags

You might want to filter your search for resources with the same Tag. You can do that by clicking  `Add filter` within the Search window.
