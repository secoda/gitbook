# Resource Management

## **Getting Started with Resource Management in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

Secoda ingests metadata and resources from your data warehouse, BI tool and ETL processes. After the metadata has been extracted, Secoda gives data teams an interface to document and manage their metadata in the same place that the rest of their data knowledge lives. This section will highlight the different ways that data teams can manage, document and share metadata and resources in Secoda.

## What is a resource?

A resource in Secoda encompasses any entity that can be enhanced with metadata and properties. This broad category includes tables, dashboards, charts, columns, queries, documents, dictionary terms, and more.&#x20;

Most resources can be accessed through their own dedicated page, which typically features tabs for Lineage and Documentation, alongside a side panel displaying the resourceâ€™s metadata and editable properties. For a breakdown of the information on the side panel, check out the page below.&#x20;

[resource-sidebar.md](resource-sidebar.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### What is resource metadata?

Metadata in Secoda refers to details about the resource that are automatically captured and cannot be modified. This includes information such as creation timestamps, resource popularity, and the resource type. Such information is crucial for understanding the lifecycle and usage of each resource within your organization.

### What are resource properties?

Properties in Secoda are editable attributes that provide additional context about a resource. These attributes can be manually entered in Secoda or pulled directly from the source. Editable properties include descriptions, documentation, ownership details, and custom properties, which offer a deeper level of customization and control.

**Metadata and Properties are the lifeblood of Secoda, the more you put in, the more you'll get out of the tool!**&#x20;

To edit properties in bulk, check out our **Editing Properties** section below!

If you're looking to add some custom properties or tags, the pages linked with walk you through that process!

[adding-custom-properties.md](adding-custom-properties.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="tags/custom-tags.md" %}
[custom-tags.md](tags/custom-tags.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Learn how to assign owners to your resources, or relate resources to one another below!

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="relating-resources.md" %}
[relating-resources.md](relating-resources.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

For changes that require manipulation outside of Secoda, you have the flexibility to export your resources to a CSV file, make offline edits, and then re-import them to apply updates across your Secoda environment. Detailed instructions on this process can be found in the corresponding section below.
