# Resource Management

## **Getting Started with Resource Management in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

Secoda ingests metadata and resources from your data warehouse, BI tool and ETL processes. After the metadata has been extracted, Secoda gives data teams an interface to document and manage their metadata in the same place that the rest of their data knowledge lives. This section will highlight the different ways that data teams can manage, document and share metadata and resources in Secoda.

## What is a resource?

In Secoda, a resource is any entity that metadata and properties can be added to. This includes, but is not limited to, tables, dashboards, charts, columns, queries, documents, dictionary terms, and more.&#x20;

Most resources can be opened into their own page. The page will include tabs for Lineage, and Documentation, and a side panel with the resources metadata and properties. For a breakdown of the information on the side panel, check out the page below.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="resource-sidebar.md" %}
[resource-sidebar.md](resource-sidebar.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### What is resource metadata?

In Secoda, metadata refers to any information about the resource that is generated automatically and therefore cannot be edited. This includes information such as the timestamp that the resource was created, the popularity of the resource, and the type.&#x20;

### What are resource properties?

In Secoda, properties refer to the any editable information about the resource either edited in Secoda or pulled from the source. This context is not automatically generated. This includes descriptions, documentation, owners, custom properties, and more.&#x20;

**Metadata and Properties are the lifeblood of Secoda, the more you put in, the more you'll get out of the tool!**&#x20;

To edit properties in bulk, check out our **Editing Properties** section below!

{% content-ref url="add-documentation/" %}
[add-documentation](add-documentation/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you're looking to add some custom properties or tags, the pages linked with walk you through that process!

{% content-ref url="adding-custom-properties.md" %}
[adding-custom-properties.md](adding-custom-properties.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="tags/custom-tags.md" %}
[custom-tags.md](tags/custom-tags.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Learn how to assign owners to your resources, or relate resources to one another below!

{% content-ref url="assigning-owners.md" %}
[assigning-owners.md](assigning-owners.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="relating-resources.md" %}
[relating-resources.md](relating-resources.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Finally, if you're looking to make changes outside of Secoda, you can export all your resources, and edit their properties in a CSV. Import the CSV back in to see all your changes! More details below.
