## Use cases for Tags

Tags are mainly used for categorization purposes, opposed to Collections which function more like folders. Tags can help differentiate between types of data, track resource status, or indicate data sensitivity.

**Common Examples of Tags:**

* **Project Status:**
  * "Draft" – Work in progress; details may be incomplete.
  * "In Review" – Undergoing evaluation by stakeholders.
  * "Deprecated" – Outdated and should not be used.
* **Data Type:**
  * "Production" - Live data
  * "Test" – Testing environment
* **Importance Levels:**
  * "Level 1" – Highest business impact.
  * "Level 2" – Moderate business impact.
  * "Level 3" – Lower business impact.
* **Business Context:**
  * "SOPs" – Standard operating procedures.
  * "Critical Data" – Essential business data elements.
  * "Key Account" – High-value customer accounts.
* **Security Classifications:**
  * "Confidential" – Restricted access required.
  * "Restricted" – Limited access.
  * "Public" – Openly accessible.
  * "HIPAA Compliant" - Indicates that the data meets the standards of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
  * "GDPR Sensitive" - Denotes data subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, requiring specific handling procedures.
* **Project Management:**
  * "Urgent" - Tasks or resources that require immediate attention.
  * "High Priority" - Important tasks that are critical to project success but less immediate than urgent items.
  * "Low Priority" - Tasks that are on the project radar but can be addressed later.

By effectively using custom tags, teams can enhance their workflow management, data organization, and security protocols, ensuring that all stakeholders have clear visibility into the status and classification of resources within the workspace.
