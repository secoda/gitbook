# Custom Tags

## How to Create Custom Tags

1. Navigate to Workspace settings by clicking the `Settings` tab in the sidebar
2. Under Workspace settings, select `Tags`
3. Click the `Create tag` button to create a new tag
4. Enter Name, Tag Description, and choose a logo and color to represent the tag
   1. The number you see under the Tag is the Hex code for the colour of the tag which can be customized

## Deleting Tags

You can delete a Custom Tag by clicking **Delete** on the same Settings page. Since this action can't be undone within the UI, you will receive a warning before you confirm that you'd like to delete the tag.

## Use cases

Tags are mainly used for categorization purposes, opposed to Collections which are like folders. Many customers use custom tags to differentiate between types of data. Some common examples:

* "Production" vs. "Test"
* Importance levels - Indicates the most to least business-critical dashboards for the business, for example
  * Level 1
  * Level 2
  * Level 3&#x20;
* Business-Related
  * "SOPs" - Standard operating procedures
  * "Critical Data" - Business critical data elements
  * "Key Account" - High-priority important accounts
* Certificates (to be more specific with the Verified Identifier tag)
  * "Verified" - The resource and its metadata is accepted and approved by the business and ready to be used
  * "In review" - The owner or stakeholders are reviewing the resource
  * "Draft" - Resource is pending, work in progress, may have some issues
  * "Deprecated" - Should not be used, is outdated or stale
* Security classifications (to be more specific with the PII Identifier tag)
  * Confidential
  * Restricted
  * Public
