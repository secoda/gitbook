## Use cases

Tags are mainly used for categorization purposes, opposed to Collections which are like folders. Many customers use custom tags to differentiate between types of data. Some common examples:

* "Production" vs. "Test"
* Business-Related
  * "SOPs" - Standard operating procedures
  * "Critical Data" - Business critical data elements
  * "Key Account" - High-priority important accounts
* Certificates (to be more specific with the Verified Identifier tag)
  * "Verified" - The resource and its metadata is accepted and approved by the business and ready to be used
  * "In review" - The owner or stakeholders are reviewing the resource
  * "Draft" - Resource is pending, work in progress, may have some issues
  * "Deprecated" - Should not be used, is outdated or stale
* Security classifications (to be more specific with the PII Identifier tag)
  * Confidential
  * Restricted
  * Public
