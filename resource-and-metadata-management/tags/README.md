# Tags

## What are Tags?

Tags are a static way to label Resources with useful context that other users in your workspace need to know. Secoda has two built-in default tags, [auto-pii-tagging.md](auto-pii-tagging.md "mention") and [verified-tag.md](verified-tag.md "mention"). To add additional tags to your workspace, you can create [custom-tags.md](custom-tags.md "mention") based on how you'd like to categorize data in your organization.

## Bulk Tagging

There are a few ways that you can tag your resources in bulk. Create an Automation to tag similar resources [automations.md](../../features/automations.md "mention"). Use the [bulk-editing-resources.md](../add-documentation/bulk-editing-resources.md "mention") feature in the Catalog to drag a Tag down to add it to multiple resources at once (similar to the click and drag feature in Excel and G-Sheets).

You can also bulk tag using our [propagating-metadata.md](../add-documentation/propagating-metadata.md "mention") feature in the Catalog. If there's a tag that you'd like to propagate to other resources with the same or similar name, or in the resource's downstream lineage, you can do so using this feature.

## Filtering for Tags

You might want to filter your search for resources with the same Tag. You can do that by clicking `Add filter` within the Search window.
