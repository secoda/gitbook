# Propagation

## Getting Started with Propagation

Secoda enables you to copy all or some of the properties from one resource to a related resource in your workspace.

To Propagate, select the Propagate button on the resource with your desired properties.

Once clicked, a popup will be shown which will allow you to chose which properties you'd like to propagate, and which related resources you'd like the properties to be propagated to. The related resources can be searched for by Exact Name, Similar Name, or Downstream Lineage. You have the option to choose one or multiple properties, and one, multiple or **Select all** resources, respectively.

In this popup, you can also chose to override existing properties on the receiving resource(s) with the ones that you're propagating. If this is not chosen, the properties will only propagate if the value is empty.
