# Editing Properties

## **Why Enrich Your Data?**

* **Clearer Insights:** Makes data easier to understand and trust, so everyone can make better decisions.
* **Streamlined Governance:** Defines clear responsibilities, ensuring data is used correctly.
* **Boosted Collaboration:** Helps teams easily share and utilize data.
* **Stronger Security:** Protects sensitive information and controls who can access it.

## How to Add Context to Your Data

Secoda integrates with your data sources to automatically bring in existing descriptions for tables, dashboards, and columns. For instance, if you connect your dbt YAML files, Secoda will sync the descriptions directly to the corresponding columns and tables.

### Automating Documentation

Automatically add property documentation by leveraging some best practices within Secoda:[documentation-best-practices.md](../../best-practices/documentation-best-practices.md "mention").

### Manually Add Enrichment

1. **Locate Your Data**: Use the Search feature or navigate directly through the Catalog to find the dataset you want to enrich.
2. **Edit Descriptions**: On the dataset overview page, click under the dataset's name to add or update its description.
3. **Enhance Documentation**: Navigate to the Documentation tab to add detailed documentation, guides, or any supplementary material.

#### Further Enrichment Options:

* **Tagging**: Apply [tags](../tags/) like PII, Verified, or custom tags to categorize and mark the status of data assets.
* **Relate Resources**: Create [links](../relating-resources.md) between different datasets to establish and visualize relationships.
* **Assign Ownership**: Define [ownership](../assigning-owners.md) for datasets to clarify responsibilities and direct queries.
