# Bulk Editing

## Introduction

Adding documentation manually to one resource at a time can be useful for small amounts of unique data. However, if you have large volumes of data requiring documentation, Secoda offers efficient solutions through both manual and automated bulk editing.

## **Bulk Editing**

1. **Navigate:**&#x20;
   * Go to any section where bulk edits are needed, such as the Catalog, Collections, Metrics, Dictionary, Documents, or Questions.&#x20;
   * For this example, we'll use the **Catalog**.
2. **Filter Resources:**&#x20;
   * Apply relevant [filters.md](../../features/filters.md "mention") to narrow down the resources you want to edit.&#x20;
   * For instance, filter by Integration=Tableau and Type=Dashboard to filter on Tableau dashboards.
3. **Select Resources:**
   * **Select All:** Click the checkbox in the upper left corner to select all visible resources.
   * **Select Individually:** Check boxes one by one for specific resources.
   * **Select a Range:** Click the first checkbox, hold the Shift key, and click the last checkbox in the range you want to edit.
4. **Execute Actions:**
   * View all available [#actions-options](bulk-editing-resources.md#actions-options "mention")by clicking the three-dot Actions button at the bottom of the screen. Options like Set PII and Verify might be suggested based on the context.
   * Choose the appropriate bulk update action from the menu and confirm your selection to apply changes.

### Actions options

* [propagating-metadata.md](propagating-metadata.md "mention")
* Set Collections
* Set tags
* Set owners
* Set published
* Set PII
* Verify
* Apply AI description
* Delete (from workspace)
* Remove from collection

### **Video resource**

To help you visualize the process of making bulk edits in Secoda, we've included a GIF that covers the essential steps: filtering resources, selecting them, choosing an action, and applying the changes.

As you can see below, we've filtered for PII resources, selected all, chose the Verify action, and applied the bulk changes.
