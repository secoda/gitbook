# Templates

As an Admin, you can create templates for:&#x20;

* Questions to streamline your team's requests so that all relevant information is provided in the question
* Documents to ensure users are capturing all required documentation&#x20;
* Dictionary terms to similarly enforce users to include all required context in a term's description

## How to Create Templates in Secoda

To create a template in Secoda, click the arrow next to **New \*Document, Question, Dictionary Term\*** and select **+ New template**.

You can create a new template or edit current ones from this view.

### Setting a Template as default

You can also set a template as the default format for editors and viewers to ask questions, create new documents or dictionary terms. To do this, click on the three dots beside the template you'd like to make the default.

In this menu, you can also delete and edit templates.
