# Templates

As an Admin, you can create templates for:&#x20;

* Questions to streamline your team's requests so that all relevant information is provided in the question
* Documents to ensure users are capturing all required documentation&#x20;
* Dictionary terms to similarly enforce users to include all required context in a term's description

### Setting a Template as default
