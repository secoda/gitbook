# AI Description Editor

The AI Assistant can now be embedded into your Catalog for one-click bulk edits to column and table descriptions. This speeds up the process of working with the AI Assistant since it can document directly in the Catalog.

## How does it work

The AI Assistant comes up with descriptions for your resources based on the metadata that already exists in your workspace. You are able to accept the description, ask for more iterations, as well as directly edit and override them. It also matches the tone, length of writing and other characteristics of descriptions that already exist across your workspace.

## How to add AI-generated descriptions

1. Click into your **Catalog** and click into a table that you'd like to add descriptions to
2. For editing one resource description:
   1. Select the orange **Generate description** button next to a table or column's description metadata&#x20;
   2. You can choose to :x:**Reject** the generated description,  :arrows\_clockwise:**Try again** or :ballot\_box\_with\_check:**Keep** it
   3.  See the description filled out automatically!
