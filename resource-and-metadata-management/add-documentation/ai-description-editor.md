# AI Description Editor

## Overview

The AI Description Editor is a powerful tool in Secoda that integrates seamlessly into your Catalog, Dictionary, and Collections. It enables one-click bulk edits to the Description field, significantly accelerating the process of enriching metadata with consistent and relevant content.

## How It Works

The AI Assistant generates descriptions for your resources by analyzing existing metadata in your workspace. It adjusts to match the tone and style prevalent in your current descriptions, ensuring consistency across the board. You have the flexibility to accept the suggested description, request additional iterations, or directly edit the text as needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Admins can further tailor the auto-generated descriptions by providing [#descriptions-custom-instructions](../../features/ai-assistant/#descriptions-custom-instructions "mention") in the AI Settings.
{% endhint %}

## How to add AI-generated descriptions

To utilize AI-generated descriptions, ensure the AI Assistant is activated in your workspace. An Admin must enable this feature through [the following steps](../../features/ai-assistant/#enabling-the-secoda-ai).

The AI can generate descriptions at both the column and table level. Follow these steps:

3. You can :ballot\_box\_with\_check:keep the AI-generated description, request a new one by clicking :arrows\_clockwise: Try again, or  :x: reject it.
