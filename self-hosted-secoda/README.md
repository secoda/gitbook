# Self-Hosted

### **Installing Secoda On-Premises**

Secoda offers multiple on-premises installation options, ranging from a Docker Compose setup to fully automated Kubernetes deployments in AWS EKS or GCP GKE. All Secoda services are distributed as container images, designed to run on any Docker-compatible container engine.

### **Recommended Installation for AWS**

For a balance of production-readiness, ease of installation, and manageability, we recommend using the **AWS ECS Terraform module**.&#x20;

### **Kubernetes Installation Options**

For greater flexibility but also higher complexity, we offer three Kubernetes deployment methods.

[Fully Automated EKS (AWS EKS Deployment)](https://github.com/secoda/aws-eks-self-hosted)

[Fully Automated GKE (GCP GKE Deployment)](https://github.com/secoda/gcp-gke-self-hosted)

[Generic Secoda Helm Chart](https://github.com/secoda/secoda-helm-generic)

The fully automated options install Secoda along with all necessary network and service dependencies. However, enterprise customers with specific security or operational requirements often prefer the **Generic Helm Chart**, which focuses solely on installing Secoda services. This option allows customers to customize their networking, Kubernetes engine, and service dependencies.

### **Trial or Testing Setup**

For quick trials or non-production environments, Secoda provides a lightweight **Docker Compose setup.**

### **Resource Requirements**

For detailed information on the resources required to run Secoda in a production environment â€” or to understand the setup handled by automated installation packages â€” refer to the README file in the [Generic Secoda Helm repository](https://github.com/secoda/secoda-helm-generic).

### Maintaining Self-hosted Instance

Customers will be notified whenever new releases are available for their self-hosted instance. To upgrade to the latest version, simply update your self-hosted instance to point to the latest version tags for both the frontend and API containers. This will automatically trigger all necessary migrations and updates. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, no infrastructure changes are required during the upgrade process.
