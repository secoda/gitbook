  API fields to customize your resources.

# Structure of Resources

## Overview

Secoda’s APIs generally follow the CRUD pattern (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The data elements that are managed with these APIs are called Resources. Generally, each resource maps to an integration, with many set and customizable properties called Metadata.&#x20;

Nearly every resource in Secoda has a parent and child. This hierarchy is shown in the diagram below. A resource has a one to many relationship with its child. For instance, a Cluster can have many Databases, a Schema can have many Tables, but a Table can’t belong to many Schemas.&#x20;

When using the API to create a Resource, the hierarchy should be respected so that each resource can be made with the appropriate parent. For example, the cluster should be made first, followed by the schema, then database, then table, then column.

## JSON Fields for API Requests

{% hint style="info" %}
The fields below are relevant for `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` requests. More fields may be returned in a `GET` request, but they are either generated by Secoda, deprecated, or otherwise not editable.
