The Secoda API is based around REST principals. You will need a [Bearer](../authentication.md) token to use the API.&#x20;

See below for the Base URL for your workspace.

| Workspace URL    | API Base URL     |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `app.secoda.co`  | `api.secoda.co`  |
| `eu.secoda.co`   | `eapi.secoda.co` |
| `apac.secoda.co` | `aapi.secoda.co` |

> If your workspace has it's own unique instance, with a URL that follows the pattern of `COMPANY-NAME.secoda.co`, the API Base URL to use will following the pattern of `COMPANY-NAME.secoda.co/api/v1`**.**
