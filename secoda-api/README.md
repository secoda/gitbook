# ðŸ–¨ Secoda API

Welcome to the Secoda API Docs. Secoda API allows you to interact with your Secoda workspace through a HTTP API. Secoda's API allows you to interact with your Secoda Workspace programatically. You can use the API to:

* Bulk invite users to your workspace and assign them roles
* Bulk edit the name, descriptions, and tags on your resources
* Build out custom integrations to pull data from Secoda or push new metadata into Secoda

### Support

If you have any questions regarding the API, please join the [Secoda Community Slack](https://via.intercom.io/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin.slack.com%2Ft%2Fsecodacommunity%2Fshared\_invite%2Fzt-mhnu278g-FktKZmZ51SDQtlu3NRAxqg\&h=13f5aaa171821956434fc25f4c759a803f98a84f-dssmg53d\_11:24933\&l=d215b12164c764d92e3bca464c2434cae72f7a22-8270396)
