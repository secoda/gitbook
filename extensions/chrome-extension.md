# Chrome

## Overview

The goal of the Chrome extension feature is to make the capabilities of Secoda more accessible directly in people's existing workflows.

It's main capabilities include:

* Searching, accessing, and editing Secoda metadata directly in tools like Looker, Tableau, Snowflake, BigQuery, and others. See [#supported-tools](chrome-extension.md#supported-tools "mention")for the full list.
* Accessing and searching resource lineage from within these tools.
* Starting conversations with Secoda AI and asking the data team questions from within these tools.
* Highlighting text and searching Secoda from anywhere on the web.

Once installed and configured, the Chrome extension will appear as a Secoda icon in the bottom right hand of your screen for easy access within a supported tool.

## Capabilities

Once you click into the Secoda icon, you will be able to see the Overview metadata of the resource, the downstream and upstream lineage, as well as a space to start a chat with the AI Assistant. This will allow you to reduce the need to jump from tool to tool, reducing the amount of time spent on workflows.

### View and Edit Resource Metadata

Access resource metadata in the supported tools to gain context about ownership, descriptions and any other enrichment that you've built out in Secoda.

You also have the ability to edit resources from the extension and push these changes into Secoda.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your permissions in Secoda will control what metadata you can see and edit when using the extension in other supported tools. For example, viewers in Secoda will not be able to push any edits.
{% endhint %}

### Access and Search Lineage

See the upstream and downstream lineage of the resource without having to leave the other tool that you are currently working in. Click into Lineage to see the relationships at different depths, use the provided search bar to search, and access the lineage graph within the Secoda UI.
