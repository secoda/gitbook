## What are Global Permissions? <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

Global Permissions are a sharing setting in Secoda. You can assign Global Permissions to individual Users, or user Groups, which will grant these selected Users/Groups access to all resources in a workspace.&#x20;

Unless a Resource or Collection is explicitly overriding the Global Permissions, any users who are not assigned Global Permissions will not have access to any Resources.&#x20;

Global Permissions allow for more granular sharing control for a workspace.&#x20;

## **How to manage Global Permissions in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

1. Navigate to Settings > Sharing, and find Global Permissions
2. Select a Group or a User who will be assigned Global Permissions and have access to all Resources

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember, Global Permissions will make it so that any user who is not assigned Global Permissions will not have access to any Resources. To grant access to Resources for specific Groups or Users, follow the instructions in [resource-permissions.md](../resource-permissions.md "mention").

## **Example Use Case of Global Permissions** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

Sarah is the Secoda workspace Admin at her company. She works with Cameron, an Editor, to create Resources in the workspace for different departments to view.

Sarah is inviting the Sales Team at the company to Secoda, and wants to make sure they only can see the Resources in the Sales Collection she created, so they don't get overwhelmed.&#x20;

1. Sarah assigns Global Permissions to herself and Cameron, so that they both have access to all Resources in the workspace.
2. Sarah then navigates to the Sales Collection, and edits the Sharing Settings so that the Collection is shared with the Sales Team Group.
3. Now, users in Sales Team Group will only have access to the Sales Collection and related Resources, and will not see any other Resources in the workspace, even if they are Published.&#x20;
