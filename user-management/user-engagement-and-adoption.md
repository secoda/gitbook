# User engagement and adoption

After you've onboarded a group of users, it's important to check back in within a few weeks to ensure that they are still engaging with the platform. If you are seeing less engagement than you had originally expected, do not get discouraged.&#x20;

As the workspace Admins, there are some strategies that you could implement to help change user behaviors and remind them to check Secoda for their data questions.&#x20;

## **Stay alert about all questions regarding data**

If you think that a question in your communication channels could be answered by using Secoda, hop into the thread and share links to the solution within Secoda. One scenario we see is of users reverting to former, less efficient ways of working. For example, users posting in Slack asking where data on "xyz" lives in Snowflake. Instead of simply sharing the name of the table, search Secoda and share the link to the product (even if the question has already been answered another way).

## **Send out recurring communications**

As a Secoda Workspace Admin, it's important to stay visible within the data community at your organization. There are quick and easy communications you can send out to keep Secoda top of mind for your users - one example being **Weekly Tips & Tricks.**

These can include short videos or how-to bullet points regarding features within the tool. For example, you can share a Search tip on filtering to see the most popular resources in your workspace; or a tip on how to bulk edit resources with the same definitions and tags.

## **Highlight user successes**

Everyone appreciates a little recognition and kudos for their efforts. Consider the following ideas to give accolades to your user's hard work within the product.

* Celebrate wins in Town Hall / All Hands meetings or in Slack
* Highlight a data community member of the month in a monthly newsletter
* Allow users to vote on well-documented resources that helped them complete a project

## **Make documentation fun!**

Friendly competition, anyone? Here are some gamification strategies to get your users excited about documenting their data.

* Create a data owner leaderboard and recognize users who:
  * Own the most number of resources
  * Have added the most terms to the Dictionary
  * Have added the most enrichment to a single resource
  * Own the most utilized resource (dashboard, document etc.)
* Plan a data scavenger hunt to get users acquainted with their data landscape, and find areas where data documentation could be improved

## **Create a data community**

People love being apart of a community and Secoda should be a place for people with similar questions and ideas to come together to collaborate. Some ideas to foster a data community could include:

* Host "Expert Lunch & Learns"&#x20;
  * Data owner in your org presents on and discusses a specific dataset, how it is currently used for analysis, and open the conversation up to other data owners
  * Secoda user highlights how the product has improved a data value stream of theirs, reducing the amount of time spent on a particular task
* Host "Metric Brainstorm Sessions"
  * Gather a group to discuss an organizational metric that needs defining
  * Have everyone come up with their own understanding of the metric, share definitions, and workshop until you all come to an agreement on a strong definition
* Career development opportunities
  * Secoda is a tool for everyone across the organization and everyone should have the opportunity to grow their data skillset
  * Consider hosting a data onboarding program, SQL trainings, or other additional trainings to promote a data culture through Learning & Development groups
