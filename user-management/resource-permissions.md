# Resource Permissions

## **How to manage resource permissions** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

You can change the permissions on every asset in Secoda. The default permissions are for everyone in your workspace that is not a guest or viewer.&#x20;

To change the permissions on any resource in Secoda, go to the right-hand side and click the three dots beside **Published/Draft.**&#x20;

You can also manage additional roles and permissions on a resource level to dictate what a user can do on a resource. The different permissions include:

* **Read-only:** Can not make any changes to the document. This person could be an editor, but still could be restricted to a resource.
* **Can-edit:** Can make changes to a document, but cannot execute query blocks in the document
* **Full-access:** Can make changes to the document and execute query blocks in it

The above can be done for a single user or for a group of users. From this view, you can view who currently has access, and add/remove users accordingly.&#x20;
