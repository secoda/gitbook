# Resource Permissions

## **How to manage resource permissions** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

You can change the permissions on every asset in Secoda. The default permissions are for everyone in your workspace that is not a guest or viewer.&#x20;

To change the permissions on any resource in Secoda, go to the right hand side and click the three dots beside **Published/Draft.**&#x20;

From here, you can view who currently has access, and add/remove users accordingly.&#x20;
