# Groups

Groups are a way to organize the members within your workspace. Once you organize your team members into Groups, you can then assign them to the appropriate Team which will give them access to all of their resources within that Team. Read more about Teams here: [teams.md](teams.md "mention")

**Benefits of Creating Groups**

* **Resource Ownership**: Assign resource ownership directly at the Group level. For example, assign ownership of all dashboards to the Business Intelligence Group in Secoda.
* **Efficient Team Assignment**: Add an entire Group to a Team in one action, bypassing the need to add members individually.

## How to create Groups

To create a new Group, click **Groups** in the Organization settings. Then, click **Add new group**.

To add new members to a Group, click **Select user**. You can also add an emoji to represent this group by clicking on the letter beside the group name.
