# Groups

## Share with groups <a href="#h_24c1579d53" id="h_24c1579d53"></a>

To make it easier to share with commonly-used groups (i.e. your company's engineering team or community team), you can create your own member groups and assign them permission to access resources.

Good to know: you can create groups for different user roles across the board. You can also give them names (i.e. Investors, Marketing team) to keep roles and permissions organized.&#x20;

## **How to create groups**

1. Go into Settings, then Groups, and you'll see a list of all your Members.&#x20;
2. Click "Add new group", give it a name, and add the members you want.
3.

    </div>
4. Once a Group is created, you can invite that Group of members to a Team in the Team's tab. Being apart of a team helps users organize their content; read more [here](https://docs.secoda.co/user-management/teams).
5. To share a resource with a particular Group, go to `Share link and permissions` at the top right of that resource, then click the `Add people or groups` button. You'll see your groups listed in the invite pop-up that appears. You can add and remove people from this same view.

You can also see which group each member of your team belongs to and see what resources that team owns. You can use your groups to assign resources to multiple people and navigate to see what different groups are able to use in Secoda.&#x20;
