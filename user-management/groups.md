# Groups

#### Share with groups <a href="#h_24c1579d53" id="h_24c1579d53"></a>

To make it easier to share with commonly-used groups (i.e. your company's engineering team or community team), you can create your own member groups and assign them permission to access resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
Good to know: you can create groups for different user roles across the board. You can also give them names (i.e. Investors, marketing team) to keep roles and permissions organized.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Here are quick instructions for group sharing:**

* Go to `Settings & Members` and you'll see a list of all your members and guests. Click the `Groups` heading at the top of that list.
* Click `Create a group`, give it a name, and add the members you want.
* To share a resource with a particular group, go to `Share` at the top right of that resource, then click the `Add people` button. You'll see your groups listed in the invite pop-up that appears. You can add and remove people from this same view.
