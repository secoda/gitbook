  Secoda is built to be super collaborative, so there's a number of ways to
  request access to the content others have created.

# Requesting Access

## How to request access

If you come across a resource within Secoda Search that you'd like to access, you can request access. Once you click **Request access**, this will send a notification to the resource owner, or if there are no designated owner(s), the workspace admins. The notification will appear in their **Tasks** tab in Inbox.
