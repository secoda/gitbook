# Sharing and Requesting Access

## **How to share data in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are a few different ways that you can share resources in Secoda.

### Teams <a href="#h_20c5e65b65" id="h_20c5e65b65"></a>

Creating Teams and adding your users to those Teams is the ideal way to share data resources. Simply follow the instructions here [#h\_20c5e65b65](sharing-resources.md#h\_20c5e65b65 "mention").&#x20;

### Change resource permissions <a href="#h_20c5e65b65" id="h_20c5e65b65"></a>

You can also manually override the Teams permissions that are set by clicking **Share link and permissions** in the top right of your resource, and clicking **Override permissions**.

Clicking **Copy link** copies the resource's unique URL to your clipboard so that you can share it with whoever you want. Still, only people with access to the resource can see it.

## How to request access

If you come across a resource within Secoda Search that you'd like to access, you can request access. Once you click **Request access**, this will send a notification to the resource owner, or if there are no designated owner(s), the workspace admins. The notification will appear in their **Tasks** tab in Inbox.
