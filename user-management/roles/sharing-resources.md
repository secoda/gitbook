# Resource Permissions
## **How to share resources in Secoda**

There are a few different ways that you can organize permissions in Secoda. Entities will inherit permissions from their parent, so if you give someone access to a Team, they will have access to all of the resources within that Team. If you give someone access to a Collection, they will have access to all of the resources within the Collection. If you give someone access to a resource, they will have access to that resource only.

### Teams permissions

Teams are the highest level of organization in Secoda. You can create teams for different departments, projects, or any other way that makes sense for your organization. You can then assign resources to teams, and all members of that team will have access to those resources.

### Collection permissions

Collections are a way to organize your resources within a team. You can create collections for different projects, or any other way that makes sense for your organization. You can then assign resources to collections, and all members of that collection will have access to those resources.

### Group permissions

Groups are a way to organize the members within your workspace, but outside of a Team. Using Teams with Collections are a more common way of organizing your resources, but Groups can be useful if you want to organize your members by job function, or any other way that makes sense for your organization.

### Entity-level permissions

You can override inherited permissions by clicking **Share link and permissions** in the top right of your resource. ![](<https://secoda-public-media-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f8587efa-6e9d-44b3-b67f-6e412d9f7562.png>)

Clicking **Copy link** copies the resource's unique URL to your clipboard so that you can share it with whoever you want. Still, only people with access to the resource can see it.
