# Sharing and Requesting Access

## **How to share data in Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are a few different ways that you can share resources in Secoda.

### Teams <a href="#h_20c5e65b65" id="h_20c5e65b65"></a>

Creating Teams and adding your users to those Teams is the ideal way to share data resources. Simply follow the instructions here [#h\_20c5e65b65](sharing-resources.md#h\_20c5e65b65 "mention").&#x20;

### Change resource permissions <a href="#h_20c5e65b65" id="h_20c5e65b65"></a>

You can also manually override the Teams permissions that are set by clicking **Share link and permissions** in the top right of your resource, and clicking **Override permissions**.

Groups are a way to organize the members within your workspace, but outside of a Team. Using Teams with Collections are a more common way of organizing your resources, but Groups can be useful if you want to organize your members by job function, or any other way that makes sense for your organization.

### Entity-level permissions

You can override inherited permissions by clicking **Share link and permissions** in the top right of your resource.

Clicking **Copy link** copies the resource's unique URL to your clipboard so that you can share it with whoever you want. Still, only people with access to the resource can see it.

## How to request access

If you come across a resource within Secoda Search that you'd like to access, you can request access. Once you click **Request access**, this will send a notification to the resource owner, or if there are no designated owner(s), the workspace admins. The notification will appear in their **Tasks** tab in Inbox.
