# Secoda API

Welcome to the Secoda API Docs. Secoda API allows you to interact with your Secoda workspace through a HTTP API. Secoda's API allows you to interact with your Secoda Workspace programatically. You can use the API to:

* Bulk invite users to your workspace and assign them roles
* Bulk edit the name, descriptions, and tags on your resources
* Build out custom integrations to pull data from Secoda or push new metadata into Secoda

### Support
