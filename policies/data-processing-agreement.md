The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

Clause 10

**Variation of the contract**

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business-related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

Clause 11

**Subprocessing**

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor’s obligations under such agreement.
2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
4. The data exporter shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority. 3

Clause 12

**Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services**

1\. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the

| <p>data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.</p><p>2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Clause 5(a) and 5(b): Suspension of data transfers and termination:**

1. The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of Clause 5(a), the data importer may process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its documented instructions as provided by the data exporter in the DPA and these Clauses.
2. The parties acknowledge that if the data importer cannot, for whatever reason, provide compliance with Clause 5(a) and/or Clause 5(b), the data importer agrees to promptly inform the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the affected part of the Services.
3. If the data exporter intends to suspend the transfer of personal data and/or terminate the affected part of the Services, it shall endeavour to first provide notice to the data importer and provide data importer with a reasonable period of time to cure the non-compliance (“Cure Period”). In addition, the data exporter and data importer shall reasonably cooperate with each other during the Cure Period to agree on what additional safeguards or other measures, if any, may be reasonably required to ensure the data importer’s compliance with the Clauses and data exporter’s compliance with applicable data protection law, in accordance with Section 3.4 of the DPA.
4. If after the Cure Period the data importer has not or cannot cure the non-compliance in accordance with paragraph (4) above then the data exporter may suspend and/or terminate the affected part of the Services in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by the data exporter prior to suspension or termination).

**Clause 5(f): Audit:**

1\. Data exporter acknowledges and agrees that it exercises its audit right under Clause 5(f) by instructing data importer to comply with the audit measures described in Clause 8 (Audits) of the DPA.

**Clause 5(j): Disclosure of subprocessor agreements**

1\. The parties acknowledge the obligation of the data importer to send promptly a copy of any onward subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.

2. The parties further acknowledge that, pursuant to subprocessor confidentiality restrictions, data importers may be restricted from disclosing onward subprocessor agreements to the data exporters. Notwithstanding this, the data importer shall use reasonable efforts to require any subprocessor it appoints to permit it to disclose the subprocessor agreement to the data exporter.
3. Even where the data importer cannot disclose a subprocessor agreement to data exporter, the parties agree that, upon the request of data exporter, data importer shall (on a confidential basis) provide all information it reasonably in connection with such sub-processing agreement to the data exporter.

**Clause 6: Liability**

1\. Any claims brought under or in connection with the Clauses shall be subject to the terms and conditions, including but not limited to, the exclusions and limitations of liability set forth in the Agreement. In no event shall any party limit its liability with respect to any data subject rights under these Clauses.

**Clause 11: Onward subprocessing**

1. The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to FAQ II.1 in Article 29 Working Party Paper WP 176 entitled “FAQs in order to address some issues raised by the entry into force of the EU Commission Decision 2010/87/EU of 5 February 2010 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries under Directive 95/46/EC” the data exporter may provide a general consent to onward sub processing by the data importer.
2. Accordingly, data exporter provides a general consent to data importer, pursuant to Clause 11 of these Clauses, to engage onward subprocessors. Such consent is conditional on the data importer’s compliance with the requirements set out in Clause 5 (Subprocessing) of the DPA.
