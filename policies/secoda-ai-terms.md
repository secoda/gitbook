# Secoda AI Terms

Last Updated August 29, 2024

These Secoda AI Terms and Conditions (”the Terms”) supplement the applicable Secoda Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) between You and Secoda, which is incorporated by reference. These Terms apply specifically to the private beta (”Beta Program” or “Beta”) that provides new features in Secoda AI driven by AI models which may be hosted by Secoda or applicable 3rd-party partners (”Models”).

In case of any conflict between the Services Agreement and these Terms as it relates specifically to Secoda AI, these Terms shall govern.  By clicking "I Accept", or proceeding with the use of Secoda AI, individually, and/or you as an authorized representative of your company on whose behalf you use Secoda AI ("You"), are indicating that you have read, understood and accept these terms and that you agree to be bound by the terms. If you do not agree with all of the terms of this agreement, you may not use Secoda AI.
