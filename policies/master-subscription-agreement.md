4. CONFIDENTIALITY
   1. Confidential Information. During the Term, a Party (“Recipient”) may be provided, or otherwise come into contact, with certain information of the other Party (“Discloser”) that is designated as ‘confidential’ and/or ‘proprietary’, or where, given the nature of the information and the circumstances of the disclosure the Recipient should reasonably understand such information to be confidential and/or proprietary to the Discloser (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information includes without limitation Discloser’s product designs, product plans, data, software and technology, financial information, marketing plans, business opportunities, proposed terms, pricing information, discounts, inventions, and know-how disclosed by Discloser to Recipient, whether in writing, verbally, or otherwise, and whether prior to, on, or after, the Effective Date. Confidential Information of Secoda also includes the Secoda Services. Confidential Information of Customer includes the Customer Data.
   2. Use. Recipient shall only use Discloser’s Confidential Information as necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and shall not divulge any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of Discloser, other than to its Representatives who have a “need to know” such Confidential Information. Representatives shall be bound by obligations at least as stringent as those contained herein with respect to the handling and use of Confidential Information, and Recipient shall remain responsible and liable for its Representatives acts and omissions with respect to Confidential Information. Recipient shall hold Confidential Information in strict confidence and take reasonable precautions to protect and secure such Confidential Information using the same degree of care it uses to protect its own similar information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.
   3. Duration. Recipient’s obligations with respect to Confidential Information under this Agreement shall continue for as long as such information remains Confidential Information. Upon termination of this Agreement, or upon written request by Discloser, the Recipient will: (i) cease using the Confidential Information; and (ii) return or destroy the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to Discloser within thirty (30) days of such request or termination.

Recipient may make disclosures to the extent required by Applicable Law or court order (“Compelled Disclosure”), provided Recipient, to the extent legally permitted, provides prompt notice of the Compelled Disclosure to Discloser, reasonably cooperates with Discloser, at Discloser’s request and expense, in contesting the Compelled Disclosure, and in any event only provides the amount of Confidential Information minimally necessary to comply with the Compelled Disclosure.
   5. Injunctive Relief; Incident. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Section may cause irreparable harm to the Discloser, for which monetary damages may be inadequate and/or difficult to quantify. As such, Discloser shall be entitled to injunctive relief without the necessity of posting a bond. Additionally, in the event Recipient discovers any actual or suspected unauthorized access to, or dissemination or disclosure of, Confidential Information (an “Incident”), Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser and fully cooperate with Discloser to limit the damage caused by the Incident, and to remediate and resolve the Incident.

11. GENERAL
    1. This Agreement, including any attachments, exhibits, or references herein, as well as all Orders and SOWs between the Parties, represents the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereto, and supersedes any other prior agreements or understandings (whether oral or written) between the Parties regarding same. Any waiver, modification, or amendment of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and the provision affected will be construed so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by Applicable Law. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
    2. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed under, the laws of the Province of Ontario and those of Canada, without regard to any of its conflict of laws principles. Any claim, suit, or cause of action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall only be brought in the provincial or federal courts located in Toronto, Ontario, and the Parties agree to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts. The Parties hereby expressly waive their right to a trial by jury. The prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees. The Parties agree that neither the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) nor the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall apply to this Agreement.

    3. All rights and remedies, whether conferred hereunder or by any other instrument or law, will be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. The failure by either party to enforce any provisions of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any subsequent enforcement of that or any other provisions.&#x20;
    4. Secoda may identify Customer as a Secoda customer, and use Customer’s name and/or logo in its marketing materials and on its website. Secoda will comply with any brand usage guidelines provided by Customer to Secoda in advance. Any other uses than those permitted in this Section 11.4 require Customer’s prior consent.

Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the affected Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact and to overcome such Force Majeure Event as soon as reasonably practicable. The period of performance hereunder will be extended for a period equal to the duration of the Force Majeure Event.&#x20;
