## How do I make the most of the free tier?

We recocmend following the Getting Started section in Secoda. If you follow these steps, you'll be able to see the full range of Secoda's data cataloguing features. You can also play around with docs, questions, collections and dictionary terms to see if it meets your needs.&#x20;

The most important thing is to get your data connected to Secoda. If you experience any difficulty connecting, please contact us via Intercom or send an email to hello@secoda.co

After your data is connected to Secoda, you'll be able to add owners, descriptions, definitions, collections, tags etc. to your data.&#x20;

## How can I see how people are using data in my organization?

As an editor in Secoda, we provide you with an analytics dashboard to see how people are using Secoda in your company. Beyond that, you can also look at queries, joins, lineage and popularity of datasets in Secoda.&#x20;

You can also use our API to visualize any information from Secoda in a BI tool.

## How is the popularity calculated?

Popularity is based on the number of times a piece of data has been queried, the number of users over a history of 180 days. Additionally, Secoda takes into account how many times a resource has been used, documented or viewed in Secoda to enhance popularity. For dashboards, the number of views, frequency of queries and when a resource was queried is also taken into account.&#x20;

## How are search results ordered in Secoda?

Search results are based on a number of factors.&#x20;

The biggest factor is if the text of the resource (in the column, table or dashboard) matches the text input into the search. The results are then ordered by popularity. This is why you may see less popular results first, if the first result matches the keyword better.

## How often does Secoda update?

You can choose when to run an extraction for each integrations. Admins can run manual syncs as well and can set the schedule on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.&#x20;

## Why can't I edit in Secoda?

Depending on your role, you may not be able to make changes to documentation in Secoda.&#x20;

You should contact someone within your organization to ask for more permissions. Depending on your role and how your organization wants to use Secoda, an Admin on your Secoda instance can change your role.

## What happens if someone edits the documentation in Secoda?

Secoda automatically pulls documentation from your tools into the app. Once edits are made to the documentation inside of Secoda, we will stop writing the documentation back to the tool. We do this to ensure you have one consistent "source of truth" for your documentation.

You can choose to write Secoda documentation back to your tool programmatically using our API.

If you would like to disable editing descriptions for a particular data source inside of Secoda, please contact us.

## When will you support \_\_\_\_ integration?

We may already be working on it! We're trying to support as many of the most popular tools as we can. Please let us know on Slack or in Intercom if there's something that you need that we don't support yet.&#x20;

## Can I give feedback on features in Secoda?

Yes! We'd love to hear from you. You can join our Slack community and provide feedback in #feature-requests. We always love building with our customers!
