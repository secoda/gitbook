# Hide Datasets from Users

## How to hide data sets from Secoda

After connecting your data resources to Secoda, you can select which datasets and tables you'd like to be accessible. To do this, start by going to the **Integrations** page on the side bar.&#x20;

From here, select the source that you'd like to hide datasets from.&#x20;

After selecting the source, click **Schema**.&#x20;

On the **Schema** page, you'll find all of the datasets that Secoda has pulled from your integration. Select the ones that you would like to be accessible on Secoda. The unchecked datasets will not be accessible.&#x20;
