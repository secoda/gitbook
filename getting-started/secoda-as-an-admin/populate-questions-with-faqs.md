# Populate Questions with FAQs

Before rolling out the tool to a larger group, we recommend populating the Questions section with some FAQs for your users. This will help users see the value in how Questions can save them time.

Read up on Secoda's Questions feature here:

{% content-ref url="../../features/ask-questions-in-secoda.md" %}
[ask-questions-in-secoda.md](../../features/ask-questions-in-secoda.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Some example questions that we have seen from customers:

* Where can I find this data?
* How is our team's data organized?
* What is the number of new customers from last month?
* What is the difference between how we use these two datasets?
