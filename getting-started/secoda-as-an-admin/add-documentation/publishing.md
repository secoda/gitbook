# Publishing within Secoda

## **Getting Started with Publishing** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

As an Admin or Editor, you're going to have access to all resources in Secoda. Viewers and Guests, on the other hand, can only view the published collections, documents, dictionary terms and questions that have been shared with them. This functionality is built into Secoda to ensure that only the resources that are relevant and documented are available for consumption.&#x20;

## Published and Draft Tags

Each resource type has the ability to be marked as Published or to remain in Draft mode. This toggle is configurable by admins and editors.

Viewers can only see resources that are Published, so for example, a published table with no published columns would show a Viewer only the metadata on the table.

Any change made to a published or draft resource will automatically get "Staged for Publishing" tag.&#x20;

Once you're ready to publish your changes, you can navigate to the "Publish" button at the top of the workspace to publish all changes

This button will show you all the changes that have been made since your last time publishing your workspace. You can accept or deny any of these changes before setting them live to viewers.

This workflow can give you and the rest of your editors a way to collaborate on data documentation without worrying about overwriting each-others changes or having changes that aren't approved by an admin go out to the rest of the organization.&#x20;

## Publish all

If you'd like to publish all of your resources within Secoda, go to **Settings > Publish.**

## Preview mode

As an editor, you can mimic what a Viewer will see in Secoda by using the "Preview" button in the top right hand corner.
