# Invite your teammates

## **Benefits** to inviting teammates to Secoda

* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Streamlines data access and collaboration, reducing confusion and improving team efficiency.
* **Centralized Data Management:** Ensures all team members access up-to-date data and documentation, minimizing errors.
* **Improved Security:** Allows precise control over data access, safeguarding sensitive information.
* **Robust Data Governance:** Facilitates the implementation of data governance policies by defining clear roles and responsibilities.

## **How to Invite Teammates**

* **Initial Setup:** As a workplace Admin, you're prompted to invite colleagues when you first access Secoda.
* **Inviting Users:** Navigate to the [Settings](../../../readme/secoda-as-an-admin/settings.md), then select '**Members**' to access the invitation controls.
* **Sending Invites:** Use the 'Invite members' button for bulk invitations or the Invite link for individual invites.
* **Assigning Roles:** Manage user roles directly from the Members page, adjusting access as necessary. For more on what permissions certain roles have, check out [**Roles.**](../../../user-management/roles.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only users with a business domain name can be invited to the workspace. If using multiple business domains, you can add them to the [allowed domains list](../../../readme/secoda-as-an-admin/customize-the-workspace.md#allowed-domains) in the Security settings.&#x20;

## **Creating Groups and Teams**

Establish groups and teams to manage user roles and access effectively. Learn more about [user-management](../../../user-management/ "mention").

## Deactivating Members

To Deactivate a member from your workspace, click **Deactivate** beside their name.&#x20;

The user's name will still appear on resources that they had previously owned, but will have a strike through their name. This can be helpful context to know who had the historical knowledge of a dataset.
