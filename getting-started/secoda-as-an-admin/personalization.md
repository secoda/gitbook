# Personalize the workspace

## **How to personalize Secoda** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are various personalization options for Secoda users. These personalization options are displayed to viewers when they first come into Secoda.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As an Admin, you're able to "lock" some of these personalizations. If you don't lock these, then Editors and Viewers can personalize their workspace as they'd like.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Steps to edit workspace background, logo and name:**&#x20;

* Go to **Settings** from the sidebar
*   Go to **Appearance** to change your workspace home background.&#x20;

    * As an admin, this is where you can lock the workspace background for other members on your team.&#x20;
    * As an editor or viewer, if your admin hasn't locked this feature, you can edit your background here.&#x20;
