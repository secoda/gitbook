# Automate workflows

By leveraging Secoda, data teams can automate manual and repetitive tasks which would improve these processes in terms of efficiency. This page provides some common customer use cases for leveraging Secoda's features to save time.

## Leveraging Secoda API to reduce ROT data

* ROT data (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) is data that is no longer relevant or of use to an organization
* The API can identify large amounts of unused and duplicate tables, then deprecate these
* End result:
  * Reduced time identifying this data manually
  * Improved data quality and security
  * Improved productivity for analysts trying to find the right data
  * Reduced costs on data storage

## Leveraging Metadata Propagation to bulk edit resources

* Make bulk edits to related resources (resources with exact/similar names or by downstream lineage)
* Use the [propagate metadata feature](https://docs.secoda.co/features/data-management/propagating-metadata) to do so in just a few clicks
* End result:
  * Reduced time spent on documentation
  * Improved documentation and data literacy

## Leveraging AI Assistant to reduce repetitive questions

* Questions feature creates a repository of all answered questions
* The AI Assistant can pull from that repository to answer similar questions
* Ask the AI directly in Slack, which will push these questions back into Secoda so that they're searchable ([slack-ai-assistant.md](../../integrations/slack-connection/slack-ai-assistant.md "mention"))
* End result:
  * Improved data literacy
  * Reduced time spent on repetitive replies to users
  * More time for analysts to focus on their most important tasks

## Leveraging Secoda API to automate PII detection

* Automatic PII detection through the API can identify resources that need to be more governed for auditing purposes
* PII can be tagged, and automatic reporting for audits can be generated
* End result:
  * Improved data security and governance
  * Reduced time spent on manual tasks

## Leveraging AI Assistant to automate documentation

* Ask the AI Assistant to document your resources and it will gather all of the metadata in your integrations to create descriptions
* Ask the AI Assistant to write you queries to generate metrics
* End result:
  * Reduced time spent on manual documentation
  * Enriched resources and improved data literacy for your team

## Leveraging Slack integration to automate change management

* Receiving notifications and alerts in Slack on changes in your data integrations that affect relevant dashboards ([#slack-notifications](../../integrations/slack-connection/#slack-notifications "mention"))
* Can set these alerts to a specific Slack channel or notify owners about these failures automatically
* End result:
  * Improved data quality
  * Reduced time spent on manual notifications
  * No broken dashboards or missed schema changes
