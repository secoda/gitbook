# Automate workflows

By leveraging Secoda, data teams can automate manual and repetitive tasks which would improve these processes in terms of efficiency. This page provides some common customer use cases for leveraging Secoda's features to save time.

## Leveraging Secoda API to reduce ROT data

* ROT data (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) is data that is no longer relevant or of use to an organization
* The API can identify large amounts of unused and duplicate tables, then deprecate these
* End result:
  * Reduced time identifying this data manually
  * Improved data quality and security
  * Improved productivity for analysts trying to find the right data
  * Reduced costs on data storage

## Leveraging Metadata Propagation to bulk edit resources

* Make bulk edits to related resources (resources with exact/similar names or by downstream lineage)

* End result:
  * Reduced time spent on documentation
  * Improved documentation and data literacy

  * Reduced time spent on repetitive replies to users
  * More time for analysts to focus on their most important tasks

## Leveraging Secoda API to automate PII detection

* Automatic PII detection through the API can identify resources that need to be more governed for auditing purposes
* PII can be tagged, and automatic reporting for audits can be generated
* End result:
  * Improved data security and governance
  * Reduced time spent on manual tasks

## Leveraging Secoda API to automate change management
