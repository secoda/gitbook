# Define Service Accounts

### Service Accounts

To make your popularity calculations more accurate, you'll want to mark your users as Service Accounts.

Check ☑️ the **Service Accounts** in the users column in the integrations tab if you'd like Secoda to recognize it is not a person that interacts with your data in a meaningful way.

Activities from Service Accounts will be weighted at much less when calculating Popularity, so that your popularity score is driven by human users, not recurring jobs.
