This can help improve the transparency and trustworthiness of the data, making it easier for business users to make informed decisions.&#x20;

The data enablement features offered by Secoda, such as Secoda AI, the Search function, data dictionaries, and data lineage visualization, can help business users quickly find and access the data they need, improving productivity and efficiency. Additionally, inviting team members to Secoda allows business users to collaborate and share data assets more easily, improving collaboration and data management within the organization.&#x20;
