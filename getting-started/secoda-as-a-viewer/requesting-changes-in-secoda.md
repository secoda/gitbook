# Requesting Changes in Secoda

## How Viewers can Request Changes

If a Viewer runs into information that needs correction, or needs to be updated, they can Request Changes on any Resource in Secoda.&#x20;

1. Click the `Request Change` button found in the sidesheet of a Resource.

## What Happens After a Change is Requested?

The **Owner** of the Resource the change was requested on, will receive a notification in their [Data Inbox](../../features/data-inbox.md) and will be able to either Approve or Deny the change. If the change is Approved, the Requested Change will be applied to the Resource.
