## What Happens After a Change is Requested?

The **Owner** of the Resource the change was requested on, will receive a notification in their [Data Inbox](../../features/data-inbox.md) and will be able to either Approve or Deny the change. If the change is Approved, the Requested Change will be applied to the Resource.
