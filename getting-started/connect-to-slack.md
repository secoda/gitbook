# Connect to Slack

To connect a Secoda to a Slack channel in your workspace:

1. We recommend you create a separate channel for Secoda purposes (i.e. #secoda-notifications), since you'll also receive notifications if there are things like schema changes or documentation edits there. &#x20;
2. After this channel is created or you've decided which channel you'd like to use, go to **Settings** in the Secoda App.&#x20;
3. Go to **Slack** from the settings menu.
4. Click **Add to Slack** and choose the channel that you'd like to receive notifications in.&#x20;
