# Connect Secoda to Slack

There are several benefits to connecting Slack to Secoda:

1. Stay updated: By connecting Slack to Secoda, you can receive notifications about changes to your data or data documentation directly in Slack. This allows you to stay up-to-date and informed about what's happening with your data, without having to constantly check Secoda or other data management tools.
2. Collaboration: Connecting Slack to Secoda allows users to ask and answer questions about your data directly from Slack. This can facilitate collaboration and help ensure that everyone has access to the information they need to make informed decisions.
3. Convenience: By integrating Slack and Secoda, you can access data-related information and communicate with team members directly from the Slack platform. This can save time and reduce the need to switch between different tools and applications.
4. Improved productivity: By streamlining communication and access to data-related information, connecting Slack to Secoda can help improve productivity and reduce the risk of errors or misunderstandings.

Overall, connecting Slack to Secoda can help your team stay updated, collaborate more effectively, and work more efficiently.

## To connect a Secoda to a Slack&#x20;

1. We recommend you create a separate channel for Secoda purposes (i.e. #secoda-notifications), since you'll also receive notifications if there are things like schema changes or documentation edits there. &#x20;
2. After this channel is created or you've decided which channel you'd like to use, go to **Settings** in the Secoda App.&#x20;
3. Go to **Slack** from the settings menu.
4. Click **Add to Slack** and choose the channel that you'd like to receive notifications in.&#x20;
