# SCIM

Enterprise plan subscribers with SAML SSO enabled can opt to enable SCIM for their workspace. SCIM, or _System for Cross-domain Identity Management_, is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning.

### Overview

If you have SAML SSO enabled with a supported identity provider, you can contact us to get SCIM enabled for your workspace.

### Configure

#### Upgrade to the Enterprise plan

Contact us to upgrade to the Enterprise plan and enable SAML SSO.

#### Configuration

To configure SCIM, you'll need to add a Token and URL to your SCIM provider.

The SCIM token is the same as the [API access token](../secoda-api/authentication.md#step-1-create-an-api-key) in Secoda. As an Admin, you can self generate it by navigating to Settings page, and clicking on API under the Workspace heading.  The SCIM URL is `https://app.secoda.co/api/v1/auth/scim`.&#x20;

Follow the directions below for your identity provider to setup the SCIM integration.
