# Google Data Studio Integration

Secoda has two methods of integrating with Google Data Studio: retrieving a session cookie and using Google OAuth

**NOTE:** _Using the Google OAuth method does not extract upstream (datasources) and downstream (charts) lineage due to the limitations of the Google Data Studio API_

**NOTE:** _The session cookies expire after 12 hours and you need to re-retrieve the cookie each time you wish to run the extraction._

## Getting Started with Session Cookies <a href="#h_21e27f5a15" id="h_21e27f5a15"></a>

There are two steps to get started using Google Data Studio with Secoda through session cookies:

1. Retrieve a Google Data Studio session cookie
2. Connect Google Data Studio to Secoda

### Retrieve Session Cookie

1. Login to [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com) and open the developer tools by _right-clicking_ and selecting **Inspect**
