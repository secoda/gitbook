# Metabase Integration

## **Getting Started with Metabase** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are three steps to get started using Metabase with Secoda:

1. Authentication
   1. Option A: Retrieve your Metabase username and password
   2. Option B: Retrieve your Session ID (SSO)
2. Retrieve your Metabase host
3. Connect Metabase to Secoda

#### **Authentication** <a href="#h_34678d4ef9" id="h_34678d4ef9"></a>

#### **Option A: Retrieve you Metabase username and password** <a href="#h_41f435a11d" id="h_41f435a11d"></a>

The easiest way to connect Metabase to Secoda is to use the username and password of a Metabase admin user. The username is in an email format.

**Option B: Create a Service Account**

1. Go to you admin console in Metabase then **People > Groups.** Click **Create a group** and call the group "Service Accounts".
2. Click into the **People** tab \*\*\*\* and click **Invite someone** and name the new user **Secoda Service Account** the email can be anything you'd like, and add them to the **Service Accounts** group. If you would like the user to have access to all metadata without any further configuration, add the user to the **Administrators** group as well. Step 4 provides instructions on how to give finer grain access controls.

3\. Copy the password that is generated for the Metabase user, this will be used to connect to Secoda later.

4\. If you'd prefer finer grain control over what the Secoda Service Account has access to, go to the **Permissions** tab and select **Collections.** For each collection you'd like the Secoda service account to have access to, select the collection and for the **Service Accounts** group toggle **Curate.** After making the changes click "Save Changes" in the top right.

**Option C: Retrieve your Session ID (SSO)**

If you use Google, Azure, or another SSO option you must follow the steps below to retrieve your Session ID. The following video also outlines the steps to retrieve your Session ID [https://www.loom.com/share/fd3f422022b041a0a757045064a2a2d6](https://www.loom.com/share/fd3f422022b041a0a757045064a2a2d6).

1. Sign out of Metabase
2. Open up the Developer console (Right click and click "Inspect")
3. Go the the "Network" tab and check the box for "Preserve log"
4. Login to Metabase
5. Go back to the Developer console and click the `google_auth` request. Go to the "Response" tab and copy the `id`
6. Go to Secoda and add the Metabase integration and instead of a password use a session token

#### **Retrieve your host** <a href="#h_efb437bf15" id="h_efb437bf15"></a>

Your **host** is the url for your Metabase instance. For example: `https://secoda.metabaseapp.com`

#### **Connect Metabase to Secoda** <a href="#h_757a3b000b" id="h_757a3b000b"></a>

After retrieving your Metbase username, password, and host , the next step is to connect to Secoda:

1. In the Secoda App, select "Add Integration" on the Integrations tab
2. Search for and select "Metabase"
3. Enter your Metabase username, password, OR session ID and host you retrieved above
