There are three steps to get started using Databricks with Secoda:

1. Create an access token
2. Connect Databricks to Secoda
3. Whitelist Secoda IP Address

### Create an access token

In your Databricks console go to the **User Settings** and generate a new access token. Save the value to be used to connect Databricks to Secoda in the second step.

### Whitelist Secoda IP Address

If your Databricks instance is behind a firewall, you'll have to whitelist Secoda's IP address to allow for metadata extractions. The IP addresses you need to whitelist are `35.175.75.15` and `3.122.13.89`
