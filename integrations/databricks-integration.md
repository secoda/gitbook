# Databricks Integration

## **Getting Started with Databricks** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are three steps to get started using Databricks with Secoda:

1. Create an access token
2. Connect Databricks to Secoda
3. Whitelist Secoda IP Address

### Create an access token

In your Databricks console go to the **User Settings** and generate a new access token. Save the value to be used to connect Databricks to Secoda in the second step.

### Connect Databricks to Secoda

Go to [https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new](https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new) and select the Databricks integration.

Enter in the following credentials:

* **Host:** This is the URL of your Databricks workspace, i.e, [dbc-dc31b5a2-597d.cloud.databricks.com](https://dbc-dc31b5a2-597d.cloud.databricks.com/)
* **Port:** This is typically 443 unless you've specified a different value in your Databricks configuration
* **Database** (Optional): **** The database for your data you'd like to import
* **Cluster:** The HTTP Path for your Cluster
* **Token:** The access token you generated in the first step

All of this information can be found under the JDBC/ODBC tab for the Advanced settings of your cluster&#x20;

After entering in the information into Secoda, click "Test Connection". After the connection is successful your can Submit and run the initial extraction.

### Whitelist Secoda IP Address

If your Databricks instance is behind a firewall, you'll have to whitelist Secoda's IP address to allow for metadata extractions. The IP addresses you need to whitelist are `35.175.75.15` and `3.122.13.89`
