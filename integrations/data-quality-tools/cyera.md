# Cyera

Cyera helps you define data sensitivity levels and automates the tagging and classification of your data. It also includes an access control component to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

Secoda's integration with Cyera not only retrieves these sensitivity tags but also matches them with existing tables and columns within Secoda. This functionality enhances data governance by making sensitivity labels visible and actionable within the Secoda environment, ensuring compliance with your organization's data privacy standards.
