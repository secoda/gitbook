## Getting started with Dataplex

There are two steps to get started using Dataplex with Secoda

1. Create a GCP Service Account JSON key
2. Connect  Dataplex to Secoda

#### Create a GCP Service Account JSON key

* Click + **Create Service Account**
* Enter a name click **Create and Continue**
* In the **Grant this service account access to project** section add the `Data Catalog Viewer` role and `Dataplex Metadata Reader` role
* Click **Done**
* Search for the Service Account that was just created, click the three dots action menu and select **Manage keys**
* Click **Add key > Create new key**
* Select **JSON** and click **Create**
* Save the JSON key to be used later

#### Connect Dataplex to Secoda

After retrieving the Service Account JSON key, the next step is to connect it to Secoda:

1. In the Secoda App, select Add Integration on the Integrations tab
2. Search for and select Dataplex
3. Enter your Dataplex Service Account JSON key retreived above
