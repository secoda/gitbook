# Connecting via SSH Tunnel

## **Getting Started with SSH Tunnels** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

Depending on how your environment is setup, the following may differ (but the general idea is the same). Tunnels require you to run `sshd`on a [**Bastion host**](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/linux-bastion/) accessible from the public internet. Our systems will open an SSH connection to your Bastion, then open a port forwarding connection to the private service that you specify. Ensure your **Bastion** host has whitelisted our NAT Gateway address: `35.175.75.15`

#### Setup <a href="#h_7ee5f8a430" id="h_7ee5f8a430"></a>

On your **Bastion** host:

```
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Add the **public key** we provided you from the [https://app.secoda.co/tunnels/new](https://app.secoda.co/tunnels/new) interface, _do not use the following_, it is just an example. On your **Bastion** host:

```
ssh-rsa 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 [ssh@secoda.co](<mailto:ssh@secoda.co>)

#### Troubleshooting <a href="#h_4e44bc0849" id="h_4e44bc0849"></a>

If you're having trouble establishing a connection with a standard tunnel, check the following:

* Check that the Secoda IP `35.175.75.15` is whitelisted on your Bastion host.
* Check that the public key _**we provide you**_ on tunnel creation is in their `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* Check permissions on the userâ€™s SSH files.
  * `~/.ssh` directory should be `0700`
  * `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file should be `0644`
* Check that the Bastion host can network to your warehouse.
  * `nc -z $warehouse_host $warehouse_port`
*   Check that you can use the bastion host from your personal machine. You will need to use _your own_ private and public keys, not the public key from the above step. Replace the values where appropriate.

    ```
    ssh -L localhost:1111:<POSTGRES_URL_OR_IP>:5432 -i <PRIVATE_KEY_NAME>.pem <BASTION_USER>@<BASTION_IP> psql -h localhost -P 1111 -U secodapostgres
    ```
