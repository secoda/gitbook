# Data Movement (ETL and Reverse ETL)

A data movement tool, such as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool, is used to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from various sources into a target system or data warehouse. It enables organizations to consolidate and integrate data from different sources, ensuring its cleanliness, compatibility, and accessibility for analysis and reporting purposes. On the other hand, a reverse ETL tool focuses on delivering processed data from the analytics environment back to operational systems or applications, allowing for real-time synchronization and action based on insights gained from the data. Both tools play crucial roles in data integration, transformation, and utilization for improved decision-making and operational efficiency.

Secoda currently integrates with the following Data Movement tools:
