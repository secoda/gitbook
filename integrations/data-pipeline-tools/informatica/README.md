## Getting Started with Informatica Data Integration

There are four steps to connect your Informatica Data Integration organization with Secoda:

1. Retrieve your Informatica host domain
2. Retrieve Username and Password credentials
3. Connect Informatica to Secoda

#### Retrieve the host domain

The host domain is the url through which you access Informatica on your browser. For example, if the homepage of your Informatica Data Integration is `https://usw1.dm2-us.informaticacloud.com/diUI/products/integrationDesign/main/home`, then your host domain is `https://usw1.dm2-us.informaticacloud.com`.

#### Retrieve the access credentials

The same username and password used to login to your Informatica account can be used to connect with Secoda.

(Optional)&#x20;

Since these credentials will be accessible to Secoda organization users who have access to your Informatica integration, we recommend creating a service account with a username and password specifically for the Secoda integration.

#### Connect Informatica to Secoda

After retrieving the host domain and user credentials, the next step is to connect to Secoda:

1. In the Secoda App, select **Add Integration** on the integration tab
2. Search for and select Informatica
3. Enter your Informatica host domain, username, and password
4. Click connect
5. Run your first sync to start pulling Informatica Data into Secoda
