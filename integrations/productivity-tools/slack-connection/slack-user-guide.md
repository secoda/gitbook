# Slack user guide

There are many ways to interact with Secoda through Slack. You can use it to search and ask questions about the metadata in Secoda, and get notified about changes within the workspace. This document outlines all the capabilities of the Slack integration with Secoda.

## Secoda AI Slackbot

You can interact with Secoda's AI Assistant directly in Slack, similar to how you would in the app. The questions and answers from the AI Assistant can then be pushed into Secoda Questions in your workspace!&#x20;

### How to use Secoda's AI Assistant in Slack

1. Ensure your Secoda Admin has enabled these features. Ask the Admin which Slack channel is connected to Secoda.
2. Ask your question in the designated Data Requests Slack channel that is connected to your workspace.
   * No need to prompt with a `/` command!
   * See [below](slack-user-guide.md#asking-questions-for-personal-use) if you'd rather not post these publicly to the channel
3. If Secoda AI has the answer, it will return that answer directly in the Slack thread
   * Your teammates are also able to hop in this thread and provide their insights
4. The answer will show two options, :white\_check\_mark:**Answered** or :x:**Incorrect**, to which any user can decide if the response was accurate
5. If marked :white\_check\_mark:**Answered**, the question and the response will then be pushed into Secoda's Question section for all users to see and reference
6. If marked :x:**Incorrect**, the question will be pushed to Secoda without a response and the Admins of the workspace will be notified to provide an answer
7. Check out our best practices documentation on how to best implement this workflow in your organization: [slack-less-than-greater-than-questions-workflow.md](../../../best-practices/slack-less-than-greater-than-questions-workflow.md "mention")

**Note**: Further ability to edit and add context to Questions pushed to Secoda can be found in the [ask-questions-in-secoda.md](../../../features/ask-questions-in-secoda.md "mention") section.

### Asking questions to Secoda AI for personal use

If you have a one off question that you don't want to be posted in Secoda Questions, you can ask the AI Assistant questions in any DM or channel by prompting it by typing `/secoda-ai` followed by the question.

The AI Assistant will reply in the channel, but this response will be _Only visible to you_.

**Note:** As you can see below, it may take around 10 seconds to load a response:relaxed:

## Push Slack thread into Secoda Questions

If a Slack conversation happens in another channel that is not listed in the Settings, you can still push this information into Secoda. Simply click the three dots, Push to Secoda, set a title of the question/conversation, and Submit.

This will be helpful for when questions are asked in Slack and a user chimes in with an answer. You won't have to copy this context into Secoda, but instead Push it into Questions with a few clicks.

## Receiving DMs from Slack

If you'd like to receive notifications as direct messages as well as in a channel, you can add the Secoda App to your Slack workspace.

If you're an owner or subscriber of a resource, you'll receive notifications about documentation or schema changes to that resource. Anyone who is an owner or assignee on a question, document, or dictionary term will receive a notification when there has been an update or change related to that resource or any related resources.

1.  Hover over "... More" in Slack and click Automations

2. Click into Apps and Search for Secoda
3. Add Secoda, and see your personal Notifications appear via DM
