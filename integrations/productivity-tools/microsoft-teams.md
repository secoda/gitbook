# Microsoft Teams

Connecting your workspace to Microsoft Teams allows you to receive notifications from Secoda regarding changes in your workspace.&#x20;

Create a channel for Secoda notifications. This can be done by going to your Team -> Manage Team -> Channels -> Add Channel. Name your channel, e.g, secoda-notifications.&#x20;

## Step 2. Create incoming webhook for the channel.
