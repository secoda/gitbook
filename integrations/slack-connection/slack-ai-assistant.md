# Slack : AI Assistant

Once you've connected your Slack workspace to Secoda by following these steps [#how-to-set-up](./#how-to-set-up "mention"), and you've enabled Secoda AI Assistant [#set-up](../../features/ai-assistant/#set-up "mention"), you are able to utilize the Slack:AI Assistant feature.

This feature will save your team time by allowing the AI Assistant to give answers to questions within Slack, and then post these questions/answers in the Questions section in your workspace!

## How to use

1. Ask your question in the designated Slack channel that is connected to your workspace
   * No need to prompt with a `/` command!
   * See [below](slack-ai-assistant.md#asking-questions-for-personal-use) if you'd rather not post these to the public channel
2. If Secoda AI has the answer, it will return that answer directly in the Slack thread
   * Your teammates are also able to hop in this thread and provide their insight as well
3. The answer will show two options, :white\_check\_mark:**Answered** or :x:**Incorrect**, to which any user can decide if the response was accurate
4. If marked :white\_check\_mark:**Answered**, the question and the response will then be pushed into Secoda's Question section for all users to see and reference
5. If marked :x:**Incorrect**, the question will be pushed to Secoda without a response and the Admins of the workspace will be notified to provide an answer

**Note**: Further ability to edit and add context to Questions pushed to Secoda can be found in the [ask-questions-in-secoda](../../features/ask-questions-in-secoda/ "mention") section.&#x20;

## Asking questions for personal use

If you have a one off question that you don't want to be posted in Secoda Questions, you can ask the AI Assistant questions in any DM or channel by prompting it by typing `/secoda-ai` followed by the question.

The AI Assistant will reply in the channel, but this response will be _Only visible to you_.

**Note:** As you can see below, it may take around 10 seconds to load a response:relaxed:
