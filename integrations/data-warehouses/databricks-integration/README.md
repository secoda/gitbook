## **Getting Started with Databricks** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are three steps to get started using Databricks with Secoda:

1. Create an access token
2. Connect Databricks to Secoda
3. Whitelist Secoda IP Address

### Create an access token

In your Databricks console go to the **User Settings** and generate a new access token. Save the value to be used to connect Databricks to Secoda in the second step.

{% hint style="info" %}
To have query history and popularity you must provide admin privileges to the token.
{% endhint %}

### Grant Secoda Access

For each warehouse you plan to connect to Secoda, the credentials must have `Can monitor` permissions (set via `SQL Warehouses > [My Warehouse] > Permissions`).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
`Can use` can be selected but will not allow for any warehouse-level query history to be accessed. `Can view` does not provide sufficient permissions
{% endhint %}

For each catalog you want to connect to Secoda, the credentials must have the following permissions:

* `USE_CATALOG`
* `USE_SCHEMA`
* `BROWSE`
* `SELECT`

### Connect Databricks to Secoda

Go to [https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new](https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new) and select the Databricks integration.

Enter in the following credentials:

* **Host:** This is the URL of your Databricks workspace, i.e, [dbc-dc31b5a2-597d.cloud.databricks.com](https://dbc-dc31b5a2-597d.cloud.databricks.com/)
* **Databricks Workspace Id:** The numerical id of your workspace, located in the url of your Databricks instance, after the "/?o=". `https://<instance_id>.cloud.databricks.com/?o=<workspace_id>`.\\
* **Access Token:** The access token you generated in the first step
* **Warehouse ID (Recommended) or Cluster ID:** This is the resource what SQL queries will run on. For the optimal experience, use a [Databricks serverless SQL warehouse](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/sql/serverless.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
To ingest table and column level lineage using Databricks Unity Catalog, a Warehouse ID must be specified.
{% endhint %}

After entering in the information into Secoda, click "Test Connection". After the connection is successful your can Submit and run the initial extraction.

### Whitelist Secoda IP Address

If your Databricks instance is behind a firewall, you'll have to whitelist [Secoda's IP address](../../../faq.md#what-are-the-ip-addresses-for-secoda) to allow for metadata extractions.&#x20;
