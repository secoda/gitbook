# Custom Integration

Don't see an integration that your team uses? Try using our Custom Integration feature, which utilizes a CSV upload to bring in **new** resources into Secoda.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This is different from our [Import and Export](../../resource-and-metadata-management/import-and-export-data.md) feature which is meant to edit metadata on existing resources, or bring in new dictionary terms.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The first step is to create the integration in Secoda. You can do this through the API, or through the UI. See the steps in the page below:

{% content-ref url="create-an-integration.md" %}
[create-an-integration.md](create-an-integration.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

After your integration is created, you'll need to set the preferences for your Integration through the UI.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="set-your-integration-preferences.md" %}
[set-your-integration-preferences.md](set-your-integration-preferences.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Now you can create and upload the CSV that you'll upload into Secoda.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="create-your-csv.md" %}
[create-your-csv.md](create-your-csv.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="upload-your-csv.md" %}
[upload-your-csv.md](upload-your-csv.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Every time you upload a CSV through this method, it is considered an extraction. You can then maintain (edit, delete, document) the resources pulled in from the extraction with the tips and tricks outlined below.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="maintain-your-resources.md" %}
[maintain-your-resources.md](maintain-your-resources.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
