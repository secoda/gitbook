# Custom Integrations

Don't see an integration that your team uses? Try using our Custom Integration feature, which allows you to upload a CSV or JSONL file to bring in **new** resources into Secoda.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This is different from our [Import and Export](../../resource-and-metadata-management/import-and-export-data.md) feature which is meant to edit metadata on existing resources, or bring in new dictionary terms.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The first step is to create the integration in Secoda. You can do this through the API, or through the UI. See the steps in the page below.

{% content-ref url="create-an-integration.md" %}
[create-an-integration.md](create-an-integration.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

After your integration is created, you'll need to set the preferences for your Integration through the UI.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="set-your-integration-preferences.md" %}
[set-your-integration-preferences.md](set-your-integration-preferences.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Now to import your resources, you can create and upload either a CSV, or a JSONL file into Secoda.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="import-your-resources/" %}
[import-your-resources](import-your-resources/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Every time you upload a CSV or JSONL file through this method, it is considered an extraction. You can then maintain (edit, delete, document) the resources pulled in from the extraction with the tips and tricks outlined below.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="maintain-your-resources.md" %}
[maintain-your-resources.md](maintain-your-resources.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
