# Custom Integrations

Custom integrations help bridge the gaps in your data ecosystem. In Secoda, there are two types of custom integrations: **File Uploads** and **Marketplace**. Both options offer flexible and effective ways to bring your entire data stack into Secoda.

### File Upload

Ideal for less technical users and resources that donâ€™t require frequent extractions, this option allows users to create and upload a CSV or JSONL file directly into Secoda.

{% content-ref url="custom-integration/" %}
[custom-integration](custom-integration/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Marketplace (Secoda SDK)

Marketplace integrations are built using the Secoda Software Development Kit (SDK). Users can upload their code to Secoda, allowing the integration to run automatically on a set schedule. Those who build a Marketplace integration with the Secoda SDK are encouraged to publish it for other Secoda users to benefit from.
