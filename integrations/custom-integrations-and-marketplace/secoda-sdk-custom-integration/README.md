# Marketplace

To create a Marketplace integration, you'll need to use the Secoda Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK is a Python-based toolkit that allows for the creation of custom Marketplace integrations. These integrations can be used to add resources and lineage to Secoda.

{% endhint %}

To start building with the Secoda SDK, there are a few steps to follow. First, you need to write your Python code. You can use the documentation below or scroll down for a [step by step example](./#example-step-by-step-integration-development)!&#x20;

{% endcontent-ref %}

Once the code is written, you can upload and connect your integration.&#x20;

### Example: Step-by-Step Integration Development

In this guide, we'll build an example integration with a data visualization service called [Cluvio](https://www.cluvio.com/). By the end, you'll be able to write scripts that can be executed locally and ready to be submitted to Secoda.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* Python (3.11 or later recommended) installed on your system.
* Secoda SDK installed via `pip install --upgrade secodadk`.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Create a new directory for your integration project. Inside this directory, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

With your virtual environment activated, install the Secoda SDK (and if exists, upgrade to the latest version)

```bash
pip install --upgrade secodadk
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Your Integration Script

Create a new Python file, `fake_cluvio_integration.py`, which will contain your integration code.

#### Step 3: Import SDK Components and define your Integration Class

At the top of your script, import the necessary components from the Secoda SDK:

```python
from secodadk import SecodaIntegration, Resource, DeclaredLineage, InternalResource, ExternalTable
```

Extend the `SecodaIntegration` class to create your own integration:

```python
class FakeCluvioIntegration(SecodaIntegration):
    def extract(self):
        # Your extraction logic goes here.
```

#### Step 4: Implement the  Extraction Logic

The `extract` method is where the integration interacts with Cluvio's API. We'll authenticate using credentials and then extract data:

```python
# Within your extract method
token_response = self.http_post(
    f"https://api.cluvio.com/users/sign_in",
    json={
        "user": {
            "email": self.credentials.get("email"),
            "password": self.credentials.get("password"),
        }
    },
    headers={"Accept": "application/json"},
)
token = token_response.json().get("token")

# Authentication requests
auth = dict(
    headers={"token": token},
    verify=True,
)


# Logic for fetching and declaring resources and lineage
...
```

Note that:

* &#x20;`self.credentials` is a dictionary provided by the `SecodaIntegration` base class, allowing you to access user inputs in the integration connect form.
* We use `self.http_post` for HTTP requests. You **must** use our `self.http_{method}` for HTTP requests. Other library like `requests` or `httpx` will not work. `self.http_{method}` returns a `httpx.Response` instance.&#x20;

With the data obtained from Cluvio, you can now declare resources (e.g., dashboards) via `self.declare_resource`

```python
# Continue your extract method
group_databuilder_id = "dashboard_group.default"
self.declare_resource(
    Resource(
        entity_type="dashboard_group",
        databuilder_id=group_databuilder_id,
        title="default",
    )
)

dashboards = self.http_get(f"https://api.cluvio.com/dashboards/", **auth).json().get("data", [])
for dashboard in dashboards:
    dashboard_databuilder_id = f"dashboard.{dashboard.get('id')}"
    self.declare_resource(
        Resource(
            entity_type="dashboard",
            databuilder_id=dashboard_databuilder_id,
            title=dashboard.get("attributes", {}).get("name"),
            description=dashboard.get("attributes", {}).get("description"),
            parent_databuilder_id=group_databuilder_id,
            external_updated_at=dashboard.get("attributes", {}).get(
                "updated_at"
            ),
            product="cluvio",
            native_type="dashboard",
        )
    )
```

See [Secoda Fields Explained](../secoda-fields-explained.md) for more information on the fields of `Resource` .&#x20;

Lineage between resources is also crucial for understanding the relationship and flow of data. This is declared via the `self.declare_lineage` method. Lineage can be between resources from the same source.

```python
self.declare_lineage(
    DeclaredLineage(
        from_identifier=InternalResource(
            databuilder_id=dashboard_databuilder_id
        ),
        to_identifier=InternalResource(databuilder_id=group_databuilder_id),
    )
)
```

Lineage can also flow from an existing resource in the workspace, to a resource brought in from the custom integration.&#x20;

```
self.declare_lineage(
    DeclaredLineage(
        from_identifier=ExternalTable(
            schema="public",
            table="orders",
        ),
        to_identifier=InternalResource(databuilder_id=dashboard_databuilder_id)
    )
)
```

#### Step 5: Testing Locally

To ensure that your integration works as expected, test it on your local machine. Set the credentials in your environment for security:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    FakeCluvioIntegration(
        credentials={
            "email": os.environ["EMAIL"],
            "password": os.environ["PASSWORD"],
        }
    ).start()
```

Run your script with the environment variables set to your Cluvio credentials:

```bash
EMAIL=your-email@example.com
PASSWORD=yourpassword
python fake_cluvio_integration.py
```

#### Step 6: Finalize Your Integration for Upload

Once you've tested your script and are happy with the results, it's time to [Upload and Connect your Custom Integration](upload-and-connect-your-custom-integration.md).

For the full code of this integration, see [here](example-integrations.md).&#x20;
