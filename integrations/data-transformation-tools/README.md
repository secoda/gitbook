# Data Transformation Tools

A data transformation tool is software used to extract data from various sources, apply transformations, and load the transformed data into a target system or data repository. These tools automate and streamline the process of data transformation, enabling organizations to cleanse, enrich, and reshape their data for analysis, reporting, and other purposes.

Secoda currently integrates with the following Data Transformation tools:

{% content-ref url="dbt.md" %}
[dbt.md](dbt.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="dbt-core.md" %}
[dbt-core.md](dbt-core.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## dbt Metadata in Lineage

Once the integration is connected, dbt metadata should flow seamlessly into your workspace. See these screenshots showing what dbt metadata overlaid on the lineage should look like if it's working as expected:
