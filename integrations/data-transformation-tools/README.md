# Data Transformation Tools

A data transformation tool is software used to extract data from various sources, apply transformations, and load the transformed data into a target system or data repository. These tools automate and streamline the process of data transformation, enabling organizations to cleanse, enrich, and reshape their data for analysis, reporting, and other purposes.

Secoda currently integrates with the following Data Transformation tools:

{% content-ref url="dbt/" %}
[dbt](dbt/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="dbt/dbt-core/" %}
[dbt-core](dbt/dbt-core/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
