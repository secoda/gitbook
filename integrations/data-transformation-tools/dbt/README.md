{% hint style="info" %}
dbt is a secondary integration that adds additional metadata on to your data warehouse or relational database tables. Before connecting dbt make sure to connect a data warehouse or relational database first. These include Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, Redshift, etc.
{% endhint %}

There are three steps to get started using dbt with Secoda:

1. Retrieve your Account ID
2. Retrieve a Service Token
3. Connect dbt to Secoda

#### **Retrieve your Account ID** <a href="#h_89d08409d1" id="h_89d08409d1"></a>

You can determine your account ID by going to the Account Settings page of dbt Cloud console. In the URL, for example in the URL below, the account ID is `12345 https://cloud.getdbt.com/settings/accounts/12345/pages/projects`

#### **Retrieve a Service Token** <a href="#h_a2cb9baed8" id="h_a2cb9baed8"></a>

Secoda uses the dbt Cloud REST API, which is only available paying dbt Cloud customers. For Secoda to retrieve metadata from dbt, you need to generate a Service Token with. To do this, go to **Account Settings > Service Tokens** and click "New Token".

The minimum permissions are **Member** of the selected projects for the Service Account. Once the projects have been selected Save the token and copy the generated token.
