# Getting Started with Looker

To view the metadata associated with one of your Looker dashboards, visit the [catalog](https://app.secoda.co/catalog) page and switch to the **Dashboard** tab, then click on the title of your Looker dashboard. That link will bring you to the following page.



**Dashboards and Looks**

The dashboards and Looks from Looker and metadata such as description, owners, tags, URL, and last updated time are brought into Secoda automatically. In addition, the related dashboards, Looks, and explores are also brought in and will display on the respective assets page.

**Explores and Views**

The explores and views in Looker are brought in as a "Table" entity. Their metadata such as description, tags, last updated time, and columns are extracted and will be displayed on the data source's page in Secoda. Columns in Secoda refer to fields like dimensions and measures on an explore.

**Lineage**

The lineage tab from Looker is brought into Secoda to feature all of the related resource to dashboards, looks, explores and views.
