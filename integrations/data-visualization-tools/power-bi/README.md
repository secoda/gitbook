## **Getting Started with Power BI** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are two options for setting up the Power BI integration on Secoda:

1. OAuth with Secoda's managed Power BI Azure Enterprise Application (**Secoda Managed**)
2. Create and manage a Power BI Azure Enterprise Application (**Self Managed**)

{% hint style="info" %}
For either option, the user that connects Power BI to Secoda must be both:

* An administrator for Azure Active Directory
* An administrator for Power BI
{% endhint %}

### Secoda Managed

The PowerBI integration uses OAuth 2.0 to connect Secoda to your Power BI workspace. To connect Power BI to Secoda follow the steps below:

1. Go to [https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new](https://app.secoda.co/integrations/new) and select the Power BI option

### Troubleshooting

#### Expired access token

This error indicates that the access\_token has expired and needs to be refreshed. In order to refresh the token, please click on the Connected button. You will then be taken through the OAuth flow to be able to refresh the token.
