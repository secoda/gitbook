# Power BI

## **Getting Started with Power BI** <a href="#h_3a4bfd6458" id="h_3a4bfd6458"></a>

There are two options for setting up the Power BI integration on Secoda, OAuth (into Secoda's managed Azure AD App) or by creating and managing your own Azure AD App.

## Option 1: OAuth

**You must be a PowerBI admin to connect through OAuth.**

The PowerBI integration uses OAuth 2.0 to connect Secoda to your Power BI workspace. To connect Power BI to Secoda follow the steps below:

1. In the Integrations section, click on New Integration, and select PowerBI.
2. Navigate to the OAuth tab, and click Connect with OAuth. You will be prompted to log in to your PowerBI Workspace.&#x20;
3. Upon successful completion of OAuth authentication with Power BI, click the Run Initial Sync button to begin a sync.

To see Lineage to your PowerBI resources from external sources, make sure you enable the following settings in the Tenant tab of the Admin API Settings section in PowerBI:

* Allow service principals to use read-only admin APIs
* Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata
* Enhance admin APIs responses with DAX and mashup expressions

## Option 2: Azure AD App

### Step 1 -> Create an Azure AD App

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Search for App registrations and start a new Registration
3. In the New Registration form, fill in the following details:
   * Name: Secoda
   * Supported account types: Accounts in this organizational directory only (Default Directory only - Single tenant)
   * Redirect URI: Leave blank
4. Click Register to submit the form. You'll now be able to access an Application ID and Tenant ID from the Overview tab. Save these values.

### Step 2 -> Create a Client Secret

1. In the certificates and Secrets tab, click the New Client Secret button.
2. The description and expiry of the client secret is up to you. Click Add, and save the Client Secret value.&#x20;

### Step 3 -> Enable API Access

Whether you set up Admin or non-admin access APIs is up to you. Admin access enables the sync of tables, columns, and measures from PowerBI datasets. These resources are used to build lineage between PowerBI and other sources (ex. Snowflake). **You will not be able to see lineage between PowerBI and other sources if are not using Admin APIs.**
