# Metadata Extracted

If your data stack includes Amplitude, then you may want to consider integrating Secoda with your Amplitude instance. We've created a space for your event-based data to be represented within the Catalog here:

You can create Event resources in Secoda for each event that you track and add metadata like descriptions, related resources, owners, etc. Check out Amplitude's documentation on managing event types and properties: [https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047138392-Manage-events-and-properties](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047138392-Manage-events-and-properties)
