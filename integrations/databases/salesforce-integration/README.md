### Getting Started with Salesforce

There are 4 steps to get started using Salesforce with Secoda:

1. Pick a method to connect to Salesforce, there are 2 options:
   1. Use your Salesforce account's username and password (tab **Password**)
   2. Use Salesforce OAuth (tab **OAuth**)
2. Setup User Permissions, Connected App, and retrieve Consumer Key and Consumer Secret
3. Retrieve your host
4. Connect Salesforce to Secoda

### Setup User Permissions, Connected App, and retrieve Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

Make sure the profile associated with your user has API Enabled permission. You can verify this:

1. Go to Setup > Administration > Users > Users and click your user's profile

If you haven't already, create a new Salesforce Connected App:

1. Go to Setup > Platform Tools > Apps > App Manager and click New Connected App

2. Follow the instruction below to complete the form to create new Connected App (or modify your existing one)&#x20;
   * There are no specific requirements for what you name the app \

3. If you're using Username & Password flow (tab **Password**):
   * Tick `Enable OAuth Settings`
   * For `Oauth Scopes`, we need at least `Manage user data via APIs (api)`
   * For Callback URL, you can use `http://localhost`

4. If you're using Salesforce OAuth flow (tab **OAuth**):
   * For Callback URL, enter `https://app.secoda.co/api/v1/oauth/from_oauth/` (or `https://<your-app>.secoda.co/api/v1/oauth/from_oauth/`)
   * For `Oauth Scopes`, we need at least `Manage user data via APIs (api)`and `Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`
   * Tick `Enable OAuth Settings` and `Enable Authorization and Credentials Flow`

5. In the next step, Go to API (Enable OAuth Settings) > Manage Consumer Details to **retrieve your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret**.
   1. Add Secoda's IP to Trusted IP Range for OAuth Web Server Flow. If not, see step 6.2 below to relax IP restriction.
      * You can find the start and end IP addresses for your region [here](https://docs.secoda.co/faq#what-are-the-ip-addresses-for-secoda)

6. Go to Setup > Platform Tools > Apps > Connected Apps > Manage Connected Apps and click Edit next to your App.
   1. If you're using Salesforce OAuth flow (**OAuth** tab), set Refresh Token Policy to `Refresh Token is valid until revoked`
   2. If you want to relax IP restrictions. Select `Relax IP restrictions` for IP Relaxation.
