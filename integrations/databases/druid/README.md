## Getting Started with Druid

There are 3 steps to get started using Druid with Secoda:

2. Retrieve Username and Password
3. Connect Druid to Secoda

### **Retrieve Druid Host and Port** <a href="#h_b3f5c96bd0" id="h_b3f5c96bd0"></a>

Identify the host domain and **port** used to access your Druid instance. These can be derived from the URL you use to access Druid in your browser:

* Format: `http://<host-domain>:<port>/`
* Default port: `8888`.

### **Retrieve Username and Password**

Druid **requires authentication** to connect. Ensure you have the correct **username** and **password** that you use to log in to your Druid instance.

### **Connect Druid to Secoda**

1. In the Secoda App, select ‘Add Integration’ on the Integrations tab
