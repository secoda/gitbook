# MongoDB

### Getting started with MongoDB

There are 3 steps to get started using MongoDB with Secoda

1. Create a database user
2. Whitelist Secoda IP Address
3. Connect MongoDB to Secoda

### Creating a database user

If you are using cloud MongoDB (Atlas), you may need to create a new database user to connect to Secoda. To do that, repeat the following steps.

1. Log into your Atlas account
2.  On the sidebar go to `Security -> Database Access` and click on `ADD NEW DATABASE USER` on the top right&#x20;

3.  Use the password authentication method and save both the user name and password. The role given to the database user can be `Only read any database` under `built-in role` but it may need to be updated at a later date when Secoda comes out with new features

### Whitelist Secoda IP Address

Once you have created the new database user, you need to add Secoda's IP address to the allowlist. To do that, repeat the following steps.

1. Log into your Atlas Account
2.  On the side, navigate to `Security -> Network Access` and click on `ADD IP ADDRESS` on the top right

    3.  Copy and paste the `connection string` to the URI field, replacing `<username>` and `<password>` with the username and password that was used to create the database user in step 1
