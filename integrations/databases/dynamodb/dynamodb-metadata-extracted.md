# DynamoDB Metadata Extracted

Secoda pulls the following metadata from DynamoDB:

* Table
  * Name
* Attribute
  * Name
  * Type
* First 1000 items

Since DynamoDB does not utilize databases or schemas, all tables and attributes are assigned to a default database and schema, named 'dynamodb' and 'default' respectively.
