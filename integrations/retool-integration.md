## Getting Started with Session Cookies <a href="#h_21e27f5a15" id="h_21e27f5a15"></a>

There are two steps to get started using Retool with Secoda through session cookies:

1. Retrieve a Google Data Studio session cookie
2. Connect Google Data Studio to Secoda

### Retrieve Session Cookie

_Secoda uses a series of REST APIs that Retool uses for its platform, which requires a session cookie. To get a session cookie follow these steps:_

1. Login to your Retool workspace and open developer tools by right-clicking and selecting **Inspect**
