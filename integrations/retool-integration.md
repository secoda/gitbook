There are two steps to get started using Retool with Secoda through session cookies:

1. Retrieve a Retool session cookie

### Retrieve Session Cookie

_Secoda uses a series of REST APIs that Retool uses for its platform, which requires a session cookie. To get a session cookie follow these steps:_
