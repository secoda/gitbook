# Salesforce Integration

### Getting Started with Salesforce

There are 4 steps to get started using Salesforce with Secoda:

1. Retrieve your Salesforce username and password
2. Setup User Permissions, Connected App, and retrieve Consumer Key and Consumer Secret
3. Retrieve your host
4. Connect Salesforce to Secoda

### Retrieve your Salesforce username and password

These are your Salesforce account's **username** and **password**

### Setup User Permissions, Connected App, and retrieve Consumer Key and Consumer Secret

Make sure the profile associated with your user has API Enabled permission. You can verify this:

1. Go to Setup > Administration > Users > Users and click your user's profile

2. Make sure `API Enabled` is ticked

If you haven't already, create a new Salesforce Connected App:

1. Go to Setup > Platform Tools > Apps > App Manager and click New Connected App

2. Complete the form to create new Connected App
   * Make sure to tick `Enable OAuth Settings` and give appropriate `Oauth Scopes`. We'd recommend selecting `Full access (full)`
   * For Callback URL, you can use `http://localhost`

3. In the next step, Go to API (Enable OAuth Settings) > Manage Consumer Details to **retrieve your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret**. You will need to store them in a secure place.
   * Add Secoda's IP to Trusted IP Range for OAuth Web Server Flow. If not, follow step 4 below to relax IP restriction.
   * _Note that this page is not available to revisit later if you're using Lighting Experience mode. To revisit this page, go to classic view Setup > Build > Create > Apps > Connected Apps and click Manage._

4. If you want to relax IP restrictions, Go to Setup > Platform Tools > Apps > Connected Apps > Manage Connected Apps and click Edit next to your App. Next, select `Relax IP restrictions` for IP Relaxation.

### Retrieve your host

Your **host** is the url for your Salesforce instance. For example: `https://secoda.my.salesforce.com`
