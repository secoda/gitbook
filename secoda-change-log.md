### July 26, 2022

#### Today, we’re excited to announce one of the bigger changes to Secoda we've created over the last year.

The problem with existing data catalogs and discovery tools is that they don't focus on publishing, approving, reproducing, and iterating on data knowledge across the company. Company data knowledge is vast and needs to service many stakeholders and use cases.

Even if a company adopts a data catalog, employees have to search through four separate locations when trying to find any data-related information: the data catalogue, a data dictionary, BI tools or Google Slides for analysis, and a Slack channel of common questions. With so much separation around search, most data knowledge continues to disappear into obscurity.Instead, **we are excited to announce Secoda's new "Data Portal", which allows every data team to create a home page for anyone search for data.**

Today, teams can collaborate in Secoda to document their data catalog, create the data dictionary, build analysis and answer common questions from one place. With this new change, teams can submit changes for review and publish a company wide "Data Portal" that contains all associated information about your data. One single plane to search for tables, analysis, queries, terms, common charts, events, syncs, ETL, and common questions.

### June 23, 2022

#### Features & Improvements

*   Improved search / load speed by 6x

    We've refactored some of our search queries to index metadata and content in Secoda much faster.
*   Editable table component across the entire app

    You can now bulk edit components in collections, columns, dictionary terms, questions and docs using the data table that many of you have enjoyed using. In addition, this allows editors to bulk delete, edit and customize their views to show viewers only what they need to see when looking through Secoda. We hope this change significantly speeds up your editing workflows in Secoda.
*   Data profiling V2

    We have launched a new version of our columns profiling, which now includes: Count, Max, Mean, Median, Min, Percent Filled, Unique counts as well as a detailed graph viewable in the column.
*   Markdown documentation in table descriptions

    Our column and table descriptions now render markdown. In order to write your documentation in markdown, you can double click on a description and toggle between the markdown editor and the preview of the markdown.
*   Questions tagging

    You can now tag resources in questions to see any related discussions to a resource. This can give business users a clear view of the types of questions others have asked about a resource and allows them to easily find what they are looking for in Secoda.
*   Lineage / schema change notifications

    Owners of resources now get notified when columns change or are added to a table that they are responsible for. In addition, Secoda will notify owners of downstream effected resources to make sure dashboards and terms stay up to date when there's changes associated to schema.
*   Link tables with Slack channels

    Each resource in Secoda can now connect to a unique slack channel. By connecting a resource to a Slack channel, data teams can monitor changes on a resource through Slack and can see a history of changes in specific channels.

### June 22, 2022

We're excited to announce our new Fivetran Integration. With this new integration, teams will be able to understand where the data in their warehouse is coming from and where is it going afterwards. The building blocks of data organization are sources that are driving data into the warehouse. Without visibility into how a Fivetran connector flows into a data source, a business user could have a more tough time navigating the data across their data warehouse.

To read more about how to configure this integration, you can visit [our docs](https://docs.secoda.co/integrations/fivetran-integration?q=fivetran).

### June 14, 2022

This week, we’ve launched a bunch of new features that will help with organization, documentation and activity tracking in Secoda.

#### Features & Improvements

*   Side sheets

    You can now preview a table in a side sheet view before navigating to it. This is also available for columns and accessible through lineage. We found that it was difficult to know if you were clicking on the right resource, with the new side sheet, you should be more confident if you’re going to a new resource.
*   Query documentation

    You can now document queries by clicking on queries in Secoda, you can add documentation to them and share them with others. This is a big feature that a lot of you have been asking about for a long time! We’re excited to introduce it.
*   Teams

    You can now see which group each member of your team belongs to and see what resources that team owns. You can use your groups to assign resource to multiple people and the navigate to see what different groups are able to use in Secoda.
*   Version history

    You can now see an activity log of changes to each resource by clicking on the clock icon on the top right hand corner of the resource. This can show you what different users have worked on in Secoda and helps to track down changes over time.

In addition, we've fixed many bugs, added some UI improvements to dictionary terms and made the search much faster.
