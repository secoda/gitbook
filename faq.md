# FAQ

## What can I do on the free tier?

Secoda recommends following the Getting Started step-by-step guide. You can also play around with docs, questions, collections and dictionary terms to see if it meets your needs.

The first, crucial step is to get your data connected to Secoda. If you experience any difficulty connecting to your data source or don't see your source as an available integration, please contact us via Intercom, our Slack community, or send an email to hello@secoda.co

After your data is connected to Secoda, you'll be able to add users, owners, descriptions, definitions, collections, tags etc. to your data.&#x20;

## Can I see how people are using our data in my organization?

As an editor in Secoda, we provide you with an analytics dashboard to see how people are using Secoda in your company. Beyond that, you can also look at queries, joins, lineage and popularity of datasets in Secoda.&#x20;

You can also use our API to visualize any information from Secoda in a BI tool.

## How is the popularity calculated?

The popularity of a piece of data depends on the number of times it has been queried, the number of users over the last 180 days. The popularity of a resource is further enhanced by the number of times it has been used, documented, or viewed on Secoda. Dashboards take into account the number of views, frequency of queries and when a resource was accessed.

## How is search ordered in Secoda?

Search results are based on a number of factors.&#x20;

This is the most important factor that determines search results: matching the text of the resource (in the column, the table, or the dashboard) with the text entered into the search.

## How often does Secoda update?

You can choose when to run an extraction for each integrations. Admins can run manual syncs as well and can set the schedule on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.&#x20;

## Can I edit in Secoda?

Editing certain resources in Secoda is only possible if you're an Editor or Admin. Depending on your role, you may not be able to make changes to documentation in Secoda.&#x20;

You should contact the admin(s) within your organization to ask for more permissions.

## What happens if someone edits the documentation in Secoda?

Documentation from your tools automatically syncs with Secoda. We will stop writing documentation back to our tool once all changes have been made to documentation inside Secoda. So that your documentation has a consistent "source of truth", we do this.

Secoda documentation can be returned programmematically through our API to your tool.

Our support team can disable the editing of descriptions for specific data sources inside Secoda if you need to.

## When will you support \_\_\_\_ integration?

There's a good chance we're already working on it! In order to support as many popular tools as possible, we are working on it diligently. If you need something that we do not support yet, let us know on Slack or in Intercom.
