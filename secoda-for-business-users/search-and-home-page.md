# Search and Home Page

### Search

Search is super important to Secoda users and we are constantly improving the functionality to provide the best experience.

You can search for any data resource using Secoda's search, including tables, columns, collections, dictionary terms, documents, and questions. You can search for terms in plain language, or by the table name and data source if you already know what you're looking for.

#### Secoda AI Assistant

The [Secoda AI](https://www.secoda.co/blog/transforming-data-discovery-using-secoda-ai) improves user experience when searching for resources. Once you’ve enabled it, you can find the AI Assistant on the lefthand panel under Search. You can also Ask AI right from the main Search. This feature will be helpful for business users who might not know where to begin when looking at data. Read more about it [here](https://docs.secoda.co/features/ai-assistant).

#### Search Tips & Tricks

Searching can be daunting if you’re not sure exactly what you’re looking for. We’ve tried to make it as seamless as possible by adding a few features to help filter down your search.

You’re able to sort by Relevance, Popularity, Last modified and Date created.

* Relevance is measured by your personal usage (tables, dashboards, docs that you’ve worked on and are relevant to you)
* Popularity is measured by how often a resource is clicked into in your workspace as well as how often it’s queried outside of the workspace
* Last modified will show you the most recently _updated_ resources
* Date created will show you the most recently _created_ resources

If you know what kind of resource you are searching for, you can filter down to that type in the All filter dropdown. There you will see every type of resource from Apps to Questions.

### Home Page

From the homepage you can view any pinned collections, data resources, and notifications. Admins can customize the homepage to add certain resources that they'd like to highlight (see screenshot below of content options). You can also initiate a search using the search bar from the home page.
