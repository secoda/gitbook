# Secoda for Business Users

Secoda is a useful tool for business users because it streamlines data management and enhances data governance within an organization. By automating data lineage and documentation, Secoda can help business users understand where their data comes from, how it has been transformed, and how it is being used. This can help improve the transparency and trustworthiness of the data, making it easier for business users to make informed decisions.&#x20;

The data discovery features offered by Secoda, such as the search function, data catalogs, and data lineage visualization, can help business users quickly find and access the data they need, improving productivity and efficiency. Additionally, inviting team members to Secoda allows business users to collaborate and share data assets more easily, improving collaboration and data management within the organization.&#x20;

### What is Secoda?

Secoda stands for **Se**archable **Co**mpany **Da**ta. Your Secoda workspace is the single source of truth for your organization’s data. With Secoda, you can find information and documentation on dashboards, tables, data terms, and more. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, you can even ask questions to your data team directly.
