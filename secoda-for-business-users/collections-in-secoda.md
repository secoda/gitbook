# Collections in Secoda

Using Collections is a great way to organize your workspace. You can think of a Collection as a folder that hosts a group of resources (tables, columns, dashboards, dictionary terms, documents, questions) pertaining to one particular subject.

These folders can be organized however makes sense to your organization, but Collections are often organized by:

* Team (e.g. Sales, Finance)
* Data Source (e.g. Tableau, Snowflake)
* Function (e.g. Onboarding)

**Here are a few use case ideas:**

* Create a collection for specific departments
* Create a “Home” collection for the entire company to see key metrics
* Create an “Investor” collection for data shared with investors
* Create an “Onboarding” collection to help new employees learn about the key data across the company
