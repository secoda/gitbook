# Dictionary & Documents

### Dictionary

The data dictionary in Secoda is one place for all of your data terms. Terms in the data dictionary are accessible through Secoda’s search, and can be referenced in other resources in your workspace.

It's simple to create Dictionary terms! See the video below walking you through the steps, where we even added the term to a specific Collection and added a Tag. Once it's created, you're able to add additional metadata like related resources.

### Documents

Documents allow the data team to store **context** on collections, datasets, and tables in one place. Use this tab to find information about your organization’s data or internal processes that are not directly tied to one specific table, term, or resource. Just like the data dictionary, all documents can be found using search, and can be directly linked in other resources in the workspace.

Below are some examples of Documents use cases we see often:

* Writing process guides
* Defining KPIs
* Posting video tutorials
