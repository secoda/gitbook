# Onboarding homepage template

Use this guide to create an introduction Document within Secoda for new users of the tool. Depending on how you have set up your workspace with Teams, this might look different.

## Steps to create an Onboarding Homepage

If you've created a default Public team that all users have access to, like the **General** default team, or another Team that is public to all users:

1. Create a Document in that Team and title it something along the lines of "Introduction to Secoda" or "What is Secoda?"
2. Add content that you'd want new users of Secoda to know when first accessing the tool. We've shared some ideas [below](onboarding-homepage-template.md#template).&#x20;
3.  Pin that Document to the General Team's Homepage by going to General Team > Home > Edit > Add Notepad > Write up a blurb similar to what's below in green and use the @ symbol to link the Document you've just created.

If you're only using **Private** Teams to organize your workspace, you can follow the same steps above but make sure to add the Intro Document to all of the relevant private Teams. You can do this by clicking into the Document and editing the sidebar Teams metadata:
