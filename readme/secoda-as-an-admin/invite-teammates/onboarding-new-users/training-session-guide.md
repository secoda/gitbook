# Training session guide

### Introduction

* Introduce yourself and your roles with the project
* Introduce Secoda high-level - AI-powered data search, cataloging, lineage and documentation platform for data teams
  * Explain your main use cases for the product, what issues and pain points it will help address
  * Explain which data is currently integrated and documented
  * Encourage users to browse and search our docs.secoda.co site for documentation

### **Demo**

Share your screen showing your Secoda workspace.

#### Homepage

* Show how the Homepage is the first thing you'll see in the product, and this is your own personal customizable homepage where you can pin certain resources that you come back to often
* Mention the different roles (Viewers, Editors, Admins) and what access the group should expect based on their roles

#### Teams

* Click into Teams and explain how you've designed them
* Explain that the Catalog hosts all of your data sources, how you're using the Documents, that the Dictionary is a space for glossary terms and metrics, the Questions is where FAQs live, and Collections are essentially folders to group a subset of each of these resources

#### Search

* Choose a resource that is particularly enriched (maybe one that is important/relevant to the group that you're presenting to) and Search for it
* Click into the resource and show off all of the metadata like descriptions, owners, tags, verification etc.
  * Explain how you are defining ownership and verification at the moment, if applicable
* Navigate to the Lineage tab to show that feature
* Next, go into Search and show off all of the search filters that will help users narrow down their search [#search](training-session-guide.md#search "mention")

#### AI Assistant

* If users don't know exactly what they want to search for, show them that they can use the AI Assistant to search in plain language
* Show a few examples of asking the AI some questions about your data: examples [prompts.md](../../../../features/ai-assistant/prompts.md "mention")
  * If your team is interested in documenting PII, you could ask it to find you all of the tables with potential PII data

#### Slack Integration

* Open up Slack to demo how to use the Slack integration to ask the AI questions about your data directly in Slack

#### Next steps

* Ask users to review the resources that they/their team owns - update descriptions and other metadata if necessary
* Ask users to test out the AI Assistant and provide feedback
* Add users to the product and assign them to their Teams
* Share any relevant documentation with users, [secoda-as-a-viewer](../../../../getting-started/secoda-as-a-viewer/ "mention")
