# Training session guide

### Introduction

* Introduce yourself and your roles with the project
* Introduce Secoda high-level - AI-powered data search, cataloging, lineage and documentation platform for data teams
  * Explain your main use cases for the product, what issues and pain points it will help address
  * Explain which data is currently integrated and documented
  * Encourage users to browse and search our docs.secoda.co site for documentation

### **Demo**

Share your screen showing your Secoda workspace.

#### Homepage

* Homepage is the first thing you'll see in the product. This is your own personal customizable homepage where you can:
  * Edit the cover image
  * Add widgets to pin certain resources that you come back to often
  * Add a private notepad for your personal notes
  * Filter the widgets for most popular to see what your teammates are searching for
* While you're here, you can also explain the different roles (Viewers, Editors, Admins) and what access the group should expect based on their roles

* Click into a Team to explain the different sections within a Team
  * The Team Homepage functions similarly to the Main homepage, but it is configured by the Admins and is specific to that Team - pin resources that the whole Team will benefit from having easy access to
  * The Catalog hosts all of your data sources - show the different integrations
  * Talk about your current use cases for Documents - what type of documentation have you built out&#x20;
  * The Dictionary is a space for glossary terms and metrics - show what you've built out so far and how you plan to use that feature&#x20;
  * Questions is where FAQs live, and also can be used for data requests - explain if/how you plan to incorporate these into workflows
  * Collections are essentially folders that allow you to group a subset of each of these resources - you might consider having separate Collections for different projects within a team
  * Note that Admins can remove any of these sections to simplify the user's experience if they don't need access to certain features

#### Search

* Choose a resource that is particularly enriched (maybe one that is important/relevant to the group that you're presenting to) and Search for it
  * Click into the resource and show off all of the metadata that you've added like descriptions, owners, tags, verification etc.
  * Explain how you are defining ownership and verification at the moment, if applicable
  * Navigate to the Lineage tab to show that feature, if applicable
*   Click into Search and show off all of the search filters that will help users narrow down their search, more details here [#search](training-session-guide.md#search "mention")

#### AI Assistant

* If users don't know exactly what they want to search for, show them that they can use the AI Assistant to search in plain language
* Show a few examples of asking the AI some questions about your data: examples [prompts.md](../../../../features/ai-assistant/prompts.md "mention")
  * If your team is interested in documenting PII, you could ask it to find you all of the tables with potential PII data&#x20;
