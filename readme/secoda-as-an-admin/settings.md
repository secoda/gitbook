# Settings

The Settings page in Secoda allows Admins to configure Account and Workspace-level settings. Editors and Viewers can manage their Profile and Notification settings here, but they won't have access to most Workspace settings.

## Accessing Settings

To access Settings, click on the workspace name in the top left of the UI, and select "Settings."
